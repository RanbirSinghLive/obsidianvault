- ## Step 1: Person-Place-Problem
	- 1. A person
		- Who is the main character(s)?
	- 2. A place
		-  Where are they?
	- 3. A problem
		- What is the situation that they are in? What is the problem that they are trying to encounter, or the goal that they are chasing after? What is that they want or they need to fix?
- ## Step 2: The 7-Point Plot Structure
	- 1. **Hook**: A compelling introduction to the story's world or characters, capturing the reader's attention.
	- 2. **Plot Turn 1**: An inciting incident that brings the protagonist into the adventure, setting the story in motion.
	- 3. **Pinch 1**: The stakes are raised with the introduction of the antagonist or major conflict, challenging the protagonist.
	- 4. **Midpoint**: A turning point where the protagonist shifts from reacting to acting, often gaining new insights or abilities.
	- 5. **Pinch 2**: The major conflict escalates, making the situation worse for the protagonist and raising tension.
	- 6. **Plot Turn 2**: The protagonist discovers something crucial that helps them resolve the conflict or defeat the antagonist.
	- 7. **Resolution**: The climax where the major conflict is resolved, and the story concludes with the protagonist changed by their experiences.
	- It's easiest to start at the end and to work your way back from there.
	- [This article](https://blog.reedsy.com/guide/story-structure/seven-point-story-structure/) has a really good breakdown of how you might think of these aspects in The Hunger Games.
- ## Step 3: World Foundations
	- Once I have the 7 points, then I like to go back and start flushing out all the other world details:
	- **Characters**: Main, supporting, and tertiary
	- **Settings or set pieces:** Areas where significant parts of the story take place.
	- **The technology**: Since I'm primarily writing sci-fi, I'm thinking about the tech and how it makes sense and how it can be explained.
	- **The lore or the backstory**: Things that aren't going to happen on scene but that are important details to remember to keep consistent.
	- **The sub-plots**: Anything separate from the main plot that's going to be important to keep track of. This could be character relationships, it could be minor quests, things that are happening in the background that you want to make sure are tidied up by the end.
	- **Objects, companies, etc**: Non-person entities that play some important role in the story.
	- And anything else that's going to be important or useful to keep track of as I start flushing out the plot.
	- Keep a separate document where I'm listing all this out so that I can stay on top of it. For Husk, this is well over 20,000 words of its own details
	- While other people might like to spend tons of time flushing this out first, I have preferred to do it as I'm working through the plot, filling in these details as necessary. That way I'm not just creating unnecessary complexity that I try to justify later by writing tons of world details into the book that don't necessarily need to be there.
- ## Step 4: Scenes
	- A scene is a loose definition, but it's usually a continuous piece of time where a character wants something and either gets it or doesn't get it.
	- As a rough estimate, most scenes in genre fiction are going to be 1,000 to 2,000 words. It's enough time for something to happen, but not so long that you risk losing a reader's attention.
	- So I estimate that my scenes are going to be 1,500 words long. Therefore, if I want a 120,000 word book, then I need to come up with 80 scenes. And I might come up with 90 to 100 to be safe, assuming I’ll cut some.
	- Now thankfully, you've already come up with at least seven of these already because each point in the seven point plot structure is going to have at least one if not multiple big scenes that correspond to it.

	- Translating the 7-point story structure to the Save the Cat structure:
		- Opening image = Hook
		- Catalyst = Turn 1
		- Break into two = Pinch 1
		- Midpoint
		- All is lost = Pinch 2
		- Break into three = Turn 2
		- Final image = Resolution
	- From this, we start to get a good idea of how many scenes we want to have in each area. And the math gets very simple here if you plan to have 100 scenes in your book
	- Now, obviously, you probably won't and shouldn't follow this to a tee, but it starts to give you some ideas for the kinds of things that might be going on and how much should be going on in between all these major parts.
	- This can also be helpful for revising. You might find after your first draft that you're really lacking in one of these areas.
- ## Step 5: Beats
	- The last step that you can do once you have your scenes is to actually list out the beats that are going to happen in each scene.
- ## Step 6: Write!
	- At some point, probably in step 4, you're going to hit a point where you feel like, "This is good enough for me to get started." If that's the case, then I think you just go ahead and get going.
