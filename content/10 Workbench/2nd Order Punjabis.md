No one is thinking about the 2nd order impacts of a Canada that is x% more Punjabi over time. There will be more Punjabis in leadership roles except for the bilingual glass ceiling that won't be broken until after next generation. 

There will be more Punjabis in the military, just like they are disproportionately represented in the Indian and Pakistani militaries.

Birth rate will also go up. Integration will be an open question. Network effects will mean impacts in schooling, social values and changing morbitiies around healthcare. Desi nursing homes and all around Punjabi supply chains will thrive. 

I can explain what Punjabis mean for Canada in a way that both cultures will understand. This may be my advantage in getting attention on Twitter.
