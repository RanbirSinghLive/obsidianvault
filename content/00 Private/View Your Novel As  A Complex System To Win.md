# View Your Novel As A Complex System To Win

Viewing novels as complex systems will help you write a great one.

The structure of a good story has many moving parts. It is a complex system made up of subsystems. In Anatomy of a Story, John Truby compares stories to the anatomy of the human body. 

Understanding each subsystem will help you build a novel project that comes to life.

Truby says that each subsystem is a web of elements that help define the other elements. No element of your story will work unless you build & define it in relation to all the other elements.

## Most other story structures are flawed.
- The 3 Act Structure is too simplistic
- The Snowflake Method lacks structure
- The hero's journey is too rigid

Truby's anatomy method is complex, structured & still flexible.

Here's how all the subsystems work:

## The premise is the spark of life.

No novel works without a big idea.

That idea should be distilled into a premise. This is the simplest combination of character & plot. It consists of a trigger event, some sense of the hero & some sense of the outcome.

A premise gives direction to the story. 

## Theme is the brain.

Every good novel makes a moral argument.

Tactful writers express their moral argument in subtle ways. 

Subtle methods include showing how the hero:

- deals with tricky situations
- pursues goals
- fights the opponent
- learns lessons

It's important to express your moral argument through character actions, so as not to be too preachy.

## Character is the heart.

Good characters have desires.

Those desires should be shared by the hero & opponent alike. This creates conflict & thus the plot. Desire is the key life force in a story. It puts the story on rails.

The characters shouldn't be written as individuals but as an interconnected web.

## Plot is the nervous system.

People get the story & plot mixed up all the time.

Plot is just a sequence of events. Revelations are the most important & entertaining of those events. The sequence, pace & intensity of your reveals are what make a good plot.

Keep your audience on an accelerating rollercoaster.

## Story structure is the skeleton.

Truby's 7 step story structure should be present in the story as a whole, but also in every scene:

1. Weakness & Need
2. Problem
3. Desire
4. Opponent
5. Plan
6. Battle
7. Self-Revelation or Twist

The details of each are too much to get into here, but I'll be breaking them down in future newsletters. Make sure to subscribe & not miss out!

## Scenes are the skin.

Most people think of a story as a series of scenes, but they're wrong.

In reality, scenes are the outward presentation of all that lies beneath. They show the theme, character web, plot & story structure in miniature.

Thinking of all the moving parts together is a lot, but necessary to great the next great novel.
