This week, I'll show you how I refined the premise of my novel.

Writing a novel starts with one big idea. This idea should take up more headspace the more you think about it. I've had a big idea for quite some time. 

I'll show you how I narrowed it down from beginning to end.

Screenwriter Jack Truby says that a premise should explain the story in one sentence. It is the simplest combination of character & plot. A premise consists of a trigger event, some sense of the hero & some sense of their outcome.

Check these 3 boxes:
- Trigger
- Hero
- Outcome

His example is from The Godfather: 

>[!quote] The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father & becomes the new Godfather.

Your premise work can take weeks & shouldn't be rushed. This will be the foundation of your novel

Unfortunately, many people don't take time refining their premise before they start writing.

# Starting with a weak foundation is never good.
- You don't know the guiding light of your novel
- Your draft will become unfocussed
- You can't explain what you're working on

Luckily, it's as easy as iterating with a critical lens.

Here's what I did:

# I started rough & ugly.

>[!quote] A bookworm shifts his studies away from school to the underworld. He watches movies, studies mannerisms, plans crimes and builds a new curriculum for the streets

Comments:
- 2 sentences instead of 1
- Very wordy
- The trigger is not clear
- Too much emphasis on the hero
- The outcome is not clear

# My iterations varied wildly.

>[!quote] A studious Sikh boy dabbles in vice with his best friend before choosing his own virtue

Comments:
- Much shorter & more readable
- Trigger is very vague. What does 'dabbles in vice' even mean?
- More efficient hero description
- Outcome is vague. What does 'choosing virtue' look like?

# Progress wasn't linear.

>[!quote] A know-it-all Sikh boy writes a textbook to become street smart but becomes embroiled in his best friend's gang in the process. Eventually he must part ways with his best friend's gang to earn his independence.

Comments:
- Too wordy again
- Trigger & Hero are much clearer
- Outcome is too vague. 'Independence' can be manifested in many ways

# I got closer.

>[!quote] To join a youth gang, a know-it-all boy writes the book on street smarts, only to become trapped in a toxic friendship.

Comments:
- Good balance of trigger, hero & outcome in 1 sentence.

# I settled on this:

>[!quote] A new recruit to the youth gang writes a textbook on street smarts & must escape a toxic friendship with the leader.

Comments:
- The trigger is clear - getting recruited to the gang
- The hero is clear - a bookish rookie gangster
- The outcome is clear - escaping a toxic friendship

Your premise will keep improving. Getting it honed early will make life easier as your write your novel.

# Spokes:
## Pre-CTA:
Your novel's premise is its foundation.

But done wrong it can be a prison:

1. Not a big enough idea
2. Unfocussed story trajectory
3. Just plain boring

Tomorrow, I'll show my subscribers how I refined my premise.

## Post-CTA:
Refining your novel's premise is hard, soul-searching work.

The end result is an easier novel writing process.

On Tuesday, my subscribers learned how I refined my premise.

## Tweet:
- [x] Pick creator-focussed sub-point
- [x] Can I add new context?

Spending months outlining a novel before writing prose is a test of resolve.

I'm going to start writing some test scenes before I'm done outlining.

I don't want to spend more time working on my novel than in my novel!

{Remember: 280 characters!}

It's hard to reverse-engineer complex problems.                                           

Look to the minds of children for a solution.

Here's how:                                                         

Kids are great at focussing us on first principles thinking.

First principles are non-reducible facts. Think of a child continually asking 'why' until you can't answer them any further. Consider breaking down your problem into a drill-down of 'why questions' & answer them yourself.

If you hit a point where your response is 'it just is like that' you've found an assumption in your thinking.

Question these assumptions to get to the root of your problem.

Hope this was helpful.
