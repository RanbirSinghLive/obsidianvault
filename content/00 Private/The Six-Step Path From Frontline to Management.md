Frontline workers are essential to the fabric of society. However, if you desire to work your way up the ladder, follow this framework:

1. Pick the right organization.
You want to work at a large and well-reputed company, with a track record of hiring from below. Transferring from a suboptimal company to one with more chances for mobility is key.

2. Give yourself runway.
Make personal finance decisions to get cashflow positive. This gives you the psychological stability to take more risks.

3. Win your game.
Your frontline role is a game to win and show your competency. You can win via a combination of metrics, relationships and reliability.

4. Keep learning.
Find opportunities to learn transferrable skills on-the-job & on weekends. You need to be able to communicate learnings well in interviews & apply them to test problems.

5. Apply with abandon.
Look for job openings that excite you. Do not rule yourself out of being worthy of a role. Let the hiring manager do that for you.

6. Repeat until CEO*
