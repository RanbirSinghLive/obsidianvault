# Intention
- To labour strongly, with focus and attention to what is needed in the moment, to ask for help when I need it, and to be tender with myself even when I don't feel powerful
- To follow my body's desire for movement, water, food, temperature, light or darkness, sound and vocalization - knowing my preferences may fluctuate and change over time
- I intend to practice receiving help from those around me when needed
- I intend to let myself refuse help when it does not suit me in the moment
- I intend to remember I am not alone, that I am working with my baby
- I intend to connect with the love around me and the love I feel for my baby
- I intend to make decisions about my care in the moment when the conversation arises and ask for help in getting the information I need to make choices that feel appropriate for me at the time
- I intend to give myself permission to be impolite and antisocial if that is what I need
- I intend to be kind with myself if things surprise me, and I find those surprises difficult
- I intend to make myself large enough to feel all the emotions that need to be felt, even those I find difficult or unsavory in my prelabor state
- I intend to rest in between contractions
- ### Pain Is...
	- Purposeful: More discomfort = more progress
	- Anticipated: You know WHY you are having discomfort and can prepare
	- Intermittent: You get breaks! All contractions come to an end
	- Normal: Labour is a normal, healthy process, not a a pathology

# Mantras
- Contractions aren't dangerous 
- We're one step closer to meeting our baby
- Each contraction is bringing our baby closer to us
- Movement brings improvement
- Let the contractions work through you
- Every Contraction Comes to an End
- There are a finite amount of contractions
- Reserve: It's almost done

# Comfort Measures:
- Early On:
	- Upon Arrival, Dim lights
	- Reminders to move
		- **Pee every hour**
		- Trying the birthball, Peanutball, Squat bar, Rebozo
		- Walking
		- Trying to different positions with all of these
	- Physical touch 
		- In between contractions: Soft, pleasurable, comforting caresses,
			- Hugs and swaying together
		- During contractions: 
			- Double hip squeeze
			- Firm grounding touch
			- Massage
			- Tennis ball counterpressure
			- Wants me close, in her eyesight, holding hands
			- Look into your partner’s eyes while they tell you firmly that “you’ve got this”
	- Comfort measures
		- Thermoregulation (are you too hot/cold)?
			- Ice water to drink
			- hot water bottle on the back
			- Cold compress on forehead or chest
			- Hot packs can be made with hot, wet towel placed in a plastic bag and wrapped with another towel
			- Cold packs (for sore back) can be used by putting ice in an examination glove and wrapping it in a wash cloth
		- Talking through things
		- Offer chapstick
		- Breathing, Vocalization
	- Nourishment
		- Offer sips of water or gatorade
		- Offer food
	- Pain Management
		- Comb
		- Discuss TENS machine
- Later:
	- Hot showers (save for when feeling like giving up)
		- Dim lights in bathroom
	- Sarah likes the hands and knees position for pushing
- If these don’t help, ASK TO BE EXAMINED
	- If Sarah asks for Epidural, we can ask for a cervical check first
- Say your safe word...you are no less a rock star!
	- **Zimbabwe is epidural safe word**

# Ranbir Tips:
- Be present, and follow Sarah's needs
- Know and be prepared to stand for birthing preferences
- Co-regulate your partner’s nervous system with your own inner calm
- Don’t take harsh things said in labour personally
- Nourish your partner’s confidence with praise and positivity
- Encourage rest to balance activity, encourage to eat and hydrate
- Don’t keep asking them if they want, just offer
	- Small sips every couple of contractions is better than getting thirsty and drinking fast
- Nourish YOURSELF (rest, eat, hydrate, move)
- Notice when a coping ritual is not working and gently suggest new ritual
- Oxytocin engenders trust, so your loving words will usually be believed
	- Eg. “if we move from this birthing ball to the shower, I can make you more comfy.”
- Take Charge Routine
	- Touch her firmly
	- Call her by her name
	- Keep eye contact with her
	- Affirm her
	- Give her a game plan

 - Gate Theory of Pain Inhibition: create pleasure to reduce pain
 - Pain Dispersion: create counter-pressure to ease pain
 - Heart shape massage -- [Heart Massage](https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1cFBsp5Voi5AHv95cCbSwkX27W4ClVIof%2Fview&design=DAENTokKP3E&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document), 
 - Prepare for relaxation in birth by offering back or foot rub every night

# BRAIN is...
- Benefits: What are the benefits of what’s being proposed to me?
- Risks: What are the risks, for me, for the baby, for my labour?
- Alternatives: What alternatives are available to me? Can we try something different?
- Intuition: What does my intuition say, how do I feel about this?
- No/Not now: Sometimes, all that’s needed is more time.

# If Labour Begins in Evening:
- Warm shower and warm drink to relax
- Go to bed (sleep between contractions)
- Do NOT turn on the light and give your energy to timing contractions
- Hydrate
- Sarah, let Ranbir sleep as much as he can if possible
- If labour is for real, it WILL get you up (Ranbir, too)

# If Labour Begins in Daytime:
- Take naps if you’re tired
- Have a “distraction project”, like a funny movie
- Eat normally and hydrate
- Don’t let your mind jump ahead of your body (“are we there yet”?)
- Be mindful about spending all your time timing contractions
- Too much attention to the process makes it feel longer
- Don’t look for labour...let it find you

# When To Go To Hospital:
- Contractions cannot be spoken through
- Birthgiver is “out of it” and moves very slowly between contractions
- Is obviously “on a different planet” (LabourLand)
- Modesty is less of a concern
- Shaky
- May have been vocalizing (moaning, humming, yelling) for a while
- Check in with 4-1-1 rule, but behaviour MORE important
- Trust the birthgiver, not the clock

# Advocacy
- Your Birthing Beloved is busy, their brain is altered, and they are vulnerable
- Even a fierce person relinquishes their values when they feel stress in labour
- Know their birth preferences well and be prepared to stand for them
	- "Sarah wants to try pushing on her side without direction for a while”
	- “No, Sarah has said her safe word and wants the epidural now, not after a bath”
- Communicate succinctly, firmly, and unemotionally
# Labour Stages
- Stage 1: Phase 1
	- Communicative
	- Contractions may get strong enough to not talk during, but still “normal” between
	- Are we there yet” Syndrome
	- Can be distracted
	- Begins to lean on things and rock the body
	- Longest phase of labour (often 12+ hours)
	- **STAY HOME**
- Stage 1: Phase 2
	- Moments of “this is bigger than I expected”
	- Trembly and barfy
	- Ritualistic behaviour
	- Louder noises during labour
	- Endorphins release (birth giver looks stoned between) Not easily distracted
	- Uninhibited (no longer worried about nudity or noises or positions)
	- Theta brainwave brings forth intuition
	- Average 6 to 12 hours
- Stage 1: Phase 3 "Transition"
	- Intensity is wild
	- Trembly and barfy
	- "I want to go home” or “I don’t want a baby anymore” phase
	- Noises can be VERY loud
	- Mother starting to grab onto things and get close to the ground
	- Can fall asleep between contractions
	- Contractions can be on top of each other
	- Feels literally like “I can’t do it”
	- Usually shortest part of labour
	- Deepened intuition, body knows how to position itself, move, and express
	- Average 10 minutes to 3 hours
- Stage 2: Phase 1
	- Contractions seem less strong
	- Big rests between sometimes
	- Mom “hiiigggghhhh”
	- Pushiness with contractions (not always..sometimes before this stage, too)
	- 10 minutes to 2 hours
-   Stage 2: Phase 2
	- Baby’s head rotates in about station +2
	- Birth giver goes from “push-y” to “push-ING” reflexively
	- Vocalizations are “grunty” sounding
	- Gets into positions that feel right
	- Like rocking a car out of a snowbank
	- Bottom starts to burn
- Stage 2: Birth
	- Baby “crowns” when head no longer goes back up
	- "Ring of fire”
	- Big shriek from birth giver
	- Primal yell keep predators away
	- Potentially prevents major tearing
	- Releases DMT
	- “Out of Body” due to deep Delta wave
	- 1 to 30 minutes
- Stage 3: Return and Birth of Placenta
	- Baby and Mother “vibe” together in Delta (don’t bug them)
	- They need time to downregulate and integrate
	- Space of unhurried discovery important
	- Baby plopped onto body of the parent is not “natural birth”
	- Mother claims their baby on their time
	- Mother’s oxytocin activates Baby and Partner
	- “afterglow”
	- Placenta slips out in a push or two
	- 5 to 30 minutes
