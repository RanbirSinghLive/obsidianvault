[[John Truby]] [[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft 

# Steps for creating story world:

1. The designing principle holds everything together. The designing principle will tell you how to define the overall arena in which your story will occur.
2. Divide the arena into visual oppositions, based on how your characters oppose one another.
3. Detail the world using three of the four major building blocks—natural settings, artificial spaces, and technology—that make up the story world, with an emphasis on what these spaces and forms inherently or typically mean to an audience.
4. Connect the story world to your hero's overall development and apply the fourth major building block of the story world, time.
5. Track the detailed development of the story world through the story structure by creating a visual seven steps.

## Finding Story World in Design Principle:
- Problem: The design principle describes linear story movement while the story world is everything surrounding the characters all at once
- To connect them, take the rough sequence of the storyline found in the design principle & expand it 3D
- Make the story world description one line

## Arena
- 1 single arena that marks the physical boundaries of the story
- Too many arenas results in fragmented stories
- 4 ways to do this:
	- large umbrella, then crosscut & condense
		- call out the larger space at the beginnining, then get narrower thru the story
	- send hero on journey through one area on a single line
		- keep the overall journey in one geo (i.e. desert, Titanic)
	- send hero on circular journey through generally the same area
	- make hero a fish out of water
	- oppositions within the arena
		- have settings reflect char oppositions i.e. Shera in his basement

## Detailing the story world
- land, people & technology (& time)
- man-made spaces
	- house
		- person's 1st enclosure
		- shape growth of the mind & well-being
		- home of the family
		- place of intimacy
		- safety vs adventure
		- ground vs sky
		- the warm house
		- the terrifying house
			- over the line from cocoon to prison
			- potentially Garfella as Happy moves to smaller apartment
		- cellar vs attic
	- the road (oppo of house)
		- call to explore
- IMPORTANT: Stories dont show audience real world, they show the story world. It isn't a copy but as humans imagine real life could be. It is human life condensed & heightened so that the audience can understand real life better

Stories as systems
	We might say that theme, or what I call moral argument, is the brain of the story. Character is the heart and circulation system. Revelations are the nervous system. Story structure is the skeleton. Scenes are the skin.
Story Direction
- Linear - single hero pursues desire
- Meandering - less intense desire from hero, covers wide territory in haphazard way
	- encounters a number of characters from diff levels of society
- Spiral - towards the centre - thrillers
- Branching - social fantasies - advanced fiction

City as Jungle
- Here the three-dimensional quality of the city is not liberating but rather the source of death—enemies lurk all around, and a fatal attack comes from any direc-tion in an instant. 
- This kind of city is typically closely packed, steaming and wet, with the residents portrayed as animals who differ only in the way they kill. 
- Many detective and cop stories have used this metaphor, to such a degree that it long ago became a cliche.

Technology (Tools):
- Transit
- Cell Phones
- Early Internet

- In most stories, the world is a physical expression of the hero & how he develops
- The world usually goes from slavery to freedom
  How is the world of slavery an expression of my hero's greatest weakness? The world should embody, highlight or accentuate the hero's weakness & draw it out in its worst form
- Hero: Slavery to Greater Slavery to Freedom 
- World: Slavery to Greater Slavery to Freedom
- The hero begins the story in a world of slavery. He struggles to reach his goal and experiences decline as the world closes in. But then, through self-revelation, he fulfills his need and becomes free in a world that is better off because of what he has done.

Time in the Story World:
- Fallacy of the Past: we can't judge people in the past
- Instead, we show them in order to judge ourselves by comparison
- You can make negative or positive comparisons
- What should be left in the past & what should be brought back?
- [x] #task Negative comparison: In my story Indian boys show genuine friendship vs today ✅ 2023-01-01
- Fallacy of the Future: Stories in the future are about predicting the future
-  Instead, they are to abstract the present to understand it better
-  Highlight forces & choices facing us today and where they could lead

Seasons:
- change of seasons show growth or decay of the world or hero
- [x] #task last stretch of story in spring before end of semester - shows Happy's final growth ✅ 2023-01-01

Holidays, single days, the perfect day

Time Endpoint
- a ticking clock to add tension

## **Story World Through Structure**
- **you have to connect the story world at every step with the hero's development
- **create a visual analog to the 7 steps**
- ### Weakness and Need: 
	- At the beginning of the story, you show a subworld that is a physical manifestation of the hero's weakness or fear.  
- ### Desire: 
	- This is a subworld in which the hero expresses his goal.  
- ### Opponent: 
	- The opponent (or opponents) lives or works in a unique place that expresses his power and ability to attack the hero's great weakness. This world of the opponent should also be an extreme version of the hero's world of slavery.
- ### Apparent Defeat or Temporary Freedom 
	- Apparent defeat is the moment when the hero wrongly believes he has lost to the opponent (we'll discuss it in more detail in Chapter 8 on plot). The world of the hero's apparent defeat is typically the narrowest space in the story up to that point. All of the forces defeating and enslaving the hero are literally pressing in on him.
	- In those rare stories where the hero ends enslaved or dead, he often experiences a moment of temporary freedom at the same point when most heroes experience apparent defeat. This usually occurs in some kind of Utopia that is the perfect place for the hero if he will only realize it in time.
- ### Visit to Death 
	- In the visit to death (another step we'll discuss in Chapter 8), the hero travels to the underworld, or, in more modern stories, he has a sudden sense that he will die. He should encounter his mortality in a place that represents the elements of decline, aging, and death.
- ### Battle 
	- The battle should occur in the most confined place of the entire story. The physical compression creates a kind of pressure-cooker effect, in which the final conflict builds to its hottest point and explodes.
- ### Freedom or Slavery 
	- The world completes its detailed development by ending as a place of freedom or greater slavery and death. Again, the specific place should represent in physical terms the final maturation or decline of the character.  

# Creating the Story World—Writing Exercise 5

■ Story World in One Line 
	Use the designing principle of your story to come up with a one-line description of the story world.
■ Overall Arena 
	Define the overall arena and how you will maintain a single arena throughout the story. Remember that there are four main ways to do this:
1. Create a large umbrella and then crosscut and condense.  
2. Send the hero on a journey through generally the same area, but one that develops along a single line.  
3. Send the hero on a circular journey through generally the same area.  
4. Make the hero a fish out of water.  
■ Value Oppositions and Visual Oppositions 
	Return to the character web of your story, and identify the value oppositions between your characters. Assign visual oppositions that complement or express these value oppositions.
■ Land, People, and Technology 
	Explain the unique combination of land, people, and technology that will make up the world of your story. For example, your story may take place in a lush wilderness inhabited only by small nomadic groups using the simplest of tools. Or it may play out in a modern city where nature has virtually disappeared and technology is highly advanced.
■ System 
	If your hero lives and works in a system (or systems), explain the rules and hierarchy of power, along with your hero's place in that hierarchy. If a larger system is enslaving your hero, explain why he is unable to see his own enslavement.
■ Natural Settings 
	Consider if any of the major natural settings-ocean, outer space, forest, jungle, desert, ice, island, mountain, plain, or river—are useful to your story world as a whole. Make sure you don't use any of them in a predictable or implausible way.
■ Weather 
	In what way might weather help you detail your story world? Focus on dramatic moments in the story —such as revelations and conflicts—when using special weather conditions. Again, avoid cliches.
■ Man-made Spaces 
	How do the various man-made spaces in which your characters live and work help you express the story structure?  
■ Miniatures 
	Decide if you want to use a miniature. If you do, what is it and what precisely does it represent? 
■ Becoming Big or Small 
	Is it appropriate for a character to become big or small over the course of the story? How does it reveal the character or theme of your story?
■Passageways 
	If a character moves from one subworld to a very different subworld, come up with a unique passageway.
■ Technology 
	Describe the crucial technology in your story, even if it involves only the most mundane and everyday tools.
■ Hero's Change or World Change 
	Look again at the overall change in your hero. Decide whether the world will change along with the hero or not and how.
■ Seasons 
	Is one or more of the seasons important to the story? If so, try to come up with a unique way to connect the seasons to the dramatic line.
■ Holiday or Ritual 
	If the philosophy of a holiday or ritual is central to your story, decide in what way you agree or disagree with that philosophy. Then connect the holiday or ritual at the appropriate story points.
■ Visual Seven Steps 
Detail the visual subworlds that you will attach to the main structure steps in your story. Look especially at these structure steps:
1. weakness or need  
2. desire  
3. opponent  
4. apparent defeat or temporary freedom 5. visit to death
6. battle  
7. freedom or slavery
Figure out how to connect the major natural settings and man-made spaces to the subworlds you use. Concentrate on the following three subworlds:
1. Weakness subworld: If your hero starts the story enslaved, explain how the initial subworld is an expression or accentuation of the hero's great weakness.
2. Opponent subworld: Describe how the opponent's world expresses his power and ability to attack the hero's great weakness.
3. Battle subworld: Try to come up with a place of battle that is the most confined space of the entire story.
