# Template: ABDCE Storytelling

**[A]** When I was (age), I (experienced something).

**[B]** In this next section, explain what happened. Where were you? Who were you with? What happened, and why did it matter so much to you at the time? Who else saw? What did you feel? What did you think was going to happen, and what happened instead?

## [B] In one single bolded sentence, share the feeling you felt.

**[D]** Now, expand on that feeling. Develop it. How did the experience play out in the rest of your life? Did you carry it with you for a long time? How did it impact other things—like say, making friends, forming relationships, trusting other people, or your ability to pursue your dreams? Did you think about it often? What was the image, or the phrase, or the specific moment that came up for you time and time again? How did your interpretation of the event change as time went on?

**[D]** When did things start to change? What caused the change? How did you start growing in a different direction? What was the moment? Similar to [B], what happened? Where were you? Who were you with? What happened, and why did it matter so much to you at that time? Who else saw? What did you feel? What did you think was going to happen, and what happened instead?

# {X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career

A few {Time} ago, I asked {X} {Niche} leaders one simple question:

“What early career mistake will you never make again?”

What I ended up walking away with was a messy notepad full of notes, a completely new way of seeing the world, and {X} profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.

Let’s dive in:

**Mistake #1: {Mistake1}**

Too often, {Role} choose to {WrongDecision}.

They {WhyDecision}. They think {Logic}. Only to end up {BadOutcome}.

Instead, {Role} should be focused on {RightDecision}.

This is what ends up leading to {PositiveOutcome}, {PositiveOutcome}, and {PositiveOutcome}.

**Mistake #2:** {Mistake2}

A good {Role} can {GoodOutcome}.

A bad {Role} can {BadOutcome}.

But a legendary {Role} can {GiantOutcome}.

Don’t get it confused: a {GoodOutcome} is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.

**Mistake #3: {Mistake3}**

Until you’ve {Milestone}, don’t take your eye off the ball.

{”RelevantQuote”}.

To this day, I hang this quote up on my wall because it reminds me {Takeaway}.

**Mistake #4: {Mistake4}**

Traditional wisdom says {TraditionalWisdom}.

But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:

-   {RightDecision1}
    
-   {RightDecision2}
    

Then, {TraditionalWisdom} works great.

**Mistake #5: {Mistake5}**

We all think we can {Decision}.

We all think we have unlimited {Resource}.

We all think we are immune to {Disaster}.

But the truth is, we’re not.

Which is why it’s much better to operate from first principles, and {RightDecision} from the very beginning.

# Template #3: Category POV

In your chosen category, share one commonly held belief most people think is true (but is actually false/wrong/outdated/misunderstood/etc.).

Next, describe the problem in detail. Explain to the reader why this commonly held belief is so prevalent in society, or how it became a commonly held belief in the first place. And finally, tell the reader what this commonly held belief has resulted in.

List off a few examples:

-   Example #1
    

-   Example #2
    

-   Example #3
    

## Now, in this subhead, tell the reader the reason this belief is flawed.

And in this first sentence, give the reader a concrete reason.

In this paragraph, expand on your argument. Share a personal story, or a study or stat that gives credibility and context to your perspective. And finally, tell the reader what new and different result they can expect if and when they abandon this old, commonly held belief and adopt this new perspective you're providing instead.

Now, tell them how:

### **In this subhead, tell them how to shift their mindset from "old" to "new."**

This first sentence is an actionable step they can take, right away.

Next, explain what they can expect as a result from shifting their mindset. What new advantages or benefits will they experience in their own life? Be specific, and paint a clear picture of the future.

### **Finally, in this subhead, tell the reader why the "old" is going away for good.**

Bring them back to the beginning of the article, and drive home your point.

Give a few quick reasons why the "old" is on its way out, and this "new" way of thinking is the future. And to send them off, give them one final reminder/example of what this new future will look like—and why it will be so valuable for them to be part of it.

# The World’s Most Valuable Skill Is {Skill}. Here Are 5 Frameworks To Help You Master It In Record Time

The world’s most valuable skill is {Skill}.

Unfortunately, {Obstacle} keeps people from ever learning how to do it. They spend hours (and usually a ton of money) trying to learn {OldWay}, all the while failing to realize the world has changed. The {OldWay} isn’t relevant anymore—because now, in order to be successful, you have to {NewWay}.

I know, because I wasted {Time} and {Money} trying to learn this myself.

But, my loss is your gain.

Here are {X} {Topic} frameworks that will save you dozens of painful hours trying to learn {Skill} yourself:

1.  **{Name}’s {Topic} Framework**
    

Hearing this completely changed the way I thought about {Topic}.

According to {Name}, all you have to do is:

-   {Step1}
    
-   {Step2}
    
-   {Step3}
    

2.  **{Name}’s {Topic} Framework**
    

Hang this up in your room somewhere—and stare at it everyday.

-   {Tip1}
    
-   {Tip2}
    
-   {Tip3}
    

3.  **{Name}’s {Topic} Framework**
    

I consider this the Bible of {Topic}.

-   {Strategy1}
    
-   {Strategy2}
    
-   {Strategy3}
    

4.  **{Name}’s {Topic} Framework**
    

Struggling with {Obstacle}?

-   {Step1}
    
-   {Step2}
    
-   {Step3}
    

5.  **{Name}’s {Topic} Framework**
    

Finally, this is how you achieve {Outcome}:

-   {Tip1}
    
-   {Tip2}
    
-   {Tip3}
    

These {X} frameworks completely changed the way I thought about {Skill}.

If only I had discovered them sooner…

# The {X}-Step Strategy That Turned {Name} Into The {Status} Of {Topic}

{Name} is the {Status} of {Topic}.

But despite being one of the most {Achievement} in the world, most people have no clue how they did what they did. And honestly, neither did I. So, I took it upon myself to binge over {X} {Assets} of theirs to study exactly how—and see if I could find a repeatable framework I could use myself to achieve {Outcome}.

{X} hours later, here’s what I learned:

**Quick Stats About {Name}**

Here are a few interesting data points to give you context, in case you're unfamiliar with {Name}:

-   {AchievementStat1}
    
-   {AchievementStat2}
    
-   {AchievementStat3}
    
-   {AchievementStat4}
    

Needless to say, they’re one of the best in the world at {Outcome}.

So... what can we learn?

**{Name}’s {X}-Step Framework For Achieving {Outcome}**

From my research, all their success can be boiled down to a very simple process:

1.  {Step1}
    
2.  {Step2}
    
3.  {Step3}
    

Pair this framework with an unmatched work ethic and you get a potent combination for rapid growth.

Let's dig in:

**Step 1: {Step1}**

For {Name}, everything begins with {Step1}.

The reason is because {Reason}.

To do this, {Name} does the following:

-   {Tactic1}
    
-   {Tactic2}
    
-   {Tactic3}
    

Simple, but highly effective.

**Step 2: {Step2}**

The next thing {Name} focuses on is {Step2}.

They do this by {Tactic}, and sometimes even {Tactic}. This is what separates them from the competition, and makes them stand out so much compared to the average person. I consider this their “secret sauce.”

Which leads us to…

**Step 3: {Step3}**

But the real reason {Name} is so successful at {Outcome} is because they are obsessive about:

-   {Tactic}
    
-   {Tactic}
    
-   {Tactic}
    

This, combined with {Step1} and {Step2} is what makes them so successful.

So, give the above and try, and maybe you will be the next {Status} of {Topic}!

# {X} Mind-Boggling Stats About The {Niche} Industry—And How Fast It’s Growing

The {Niche} industry is on fire.

Some stats that will blow your mind:

1.  {Stat1}
    

2.  {Stat2}
    

3.  {Stat3}
    

But it’s not until you break each of these down that you realize how quickly the {Niche} industry is really growing:

1.  **{Stat1}**
    

This is an impressive stat at face value. But what’s 10x more impressive is {SecondaryStat}. That’s {X} times bigger than {ComparableIndustry}.

This is a signal of where things might be headed.

2.  **{Stat2}**
    

The last time an industry saw growth like this, it was in {Date} when {Niche} was {Outcome}. (Fun fact: {FunFact}.)

And I’m betting the same thing will happen again here.

3.  **{Stat3}**
    

As if the above wasn’t impressive enough, this stat is just mind-boggling.

To give you a sense of how big that is, that’s {EverydayComparison1}. Or {EverydayComparison2}. Or {EverydayComparison3}.

Just to put things in perspective.

**Final Prediction**

My guess is that the {Niche} is going to eventually overtake {ComparableIndustry1} the same way {Niche} overtook {ComparableIndustry2}. And at this rate, that will probably happen by {Date}.

What do you think? Do you agree? Disagree?

Let me know in the comments.

# I Just {LifeAchievement}: {X} Lessons About {Topic}

When I {OldLifeCompleted}, I {NewLifeBeginning}.

It was {NegativeDetail}. {NegativeDetail}. {NegativeDetail}. Honestly, the whole thing was really challenging—mentally and emotionally.

{X} years later, I just {LifeAchievement}. One of the best days of my life. But the journey was tough.

Here’s what those difficult years taught me about {Topic}:

**Lesson 1: {Lesson1}**

Back then, I used to {PositiveHabit}.

Despite {NegativeObstacle}.

The only difference between then and now is {UnexpectedSmallDetail}.

**Lesson 2: {Lesson2}**

For the first few years, all I had was a {HumbleBeginning} and a {HumbleBeginning}.

Since then, I’ve {PositiveOutcome}. But can I tell you something? Those two {HumbleBeginnings} still mean more to me than anything.

I learned early on that’s really all you need.

**Lesson 3: {Lesson3}**

When I was first starting out, I was so determined to achieve {X} that I deprived myself of {ShortTermOutcome}.

Everyone thought I was crazy. They used to say {NegativeComment}. But, {X} years later, I had successfully become {Outcome}.

Meanwhile, a lot of people around me hadn’t moved at all.

**Lesson 4: {Lesson4}**

I used to be very insecure about {Weakness}.

I was ashamed that I didn’t have {Outcome}. And I didn’t {PositiveAction} because of it. It took me a long time to realize those insecurities were holding me back.

And no amount of success would fix them for me.

**Lesson 5: {Lesson5}**

After college, a lot of people around me said:

{WrongAdvice}

But then I’d watch them struggle to make progress in their own lives. For years, they insisted I was should be more like them. (A lot of people told me I was “missing out.”)

But a big part of success is going in a different direction.

And remember: if it was easy, everyone would do it.

# Template: Personal Story

In this first sentence, share one specific moment of significance.

Next, put the reader in your shoes. Go back to that moment and show the reader what life looked like. What was going on in the time—outside in your physical world, and inside in your emotional world? What were some of your wants and needs at the time? What physical objects populated your experience? What was on your desk? What did your bedroom look like, your house, apartment, or dorm room? What was your biggest insecurity at the time, and what was the thing you appreciated most about yourself?

Now, tell the reader why you wanted to change.

## In one bolded sentence, tell the reader what you hoped for yourself.

Back then, where did you want your life to go? Who did you want to become? What were your aspirations, and why was it so important for you to change? What did you hope would happen as a result?

Now, fast-forward: in one sentence, tell the reader whether you were right or not.

## In one bolded sentence, tell the reader what that change actually led to.

Were you let down? Or did things turn out better than you even imagined?

What was the result?

## Finally, in one bolded sentence, tell the reader the morale of the story.

Why are you sharing this with the reader?

More importantly, what can they learn about themselves, through you?

# The Untold Story Of How {ThoughtLeader} Created {Creation} And Became {Status}

While no one was looking, {ThoughtLeader} created {Creation}, {Description} {Status}.

And today, {Creation} is one of the world’s most {Achievement}.

I have been fascinated by {ThoughtLeader}’s story for years, but recently I decided to go fully down the rabbit hole and learn everything I possibly could on {His/Her/Their} origin story and path to success. I probably spent {X} hours watching interviews, reading news articles, and listening to podcasts, taking notes and trying to piece their path together in a coherent way. Finally, I distilled their remarkable story down into a short essay for you to enjoy.

Here’s {ThoughtLeader}’s story:

**QUICK BACKSTORY:**

-   {ThoughtLeader} grew up in {Place}.
    
-   {Obstacle}
    
-   {WeirdFact}
    

**THE ODDS:**

To say {ThoughtLeader} was setup for success from the beginning would be an overstatement.

The odds of success for {Comparison} are {Odds}. And only {X%} make it to {FirstAccomplishment}. Which means {ThoughtLeader}’s odds of success were pretty much slim to none.

(Hey, that’s what makes for a great story!)

**THE GOAL:**

But {ThoughtLeader} had {His/Her/Their} sights set on {Goal}.

And for {Time}, they were relentless about {Habit1}, {Habit2}, {Habit3}.

**THE OBSTACLE:**

Unfortunately, success turned out to be a lot harder than they originally imagined.

-   {Obstacle1}
    
-   {Obstacle2}
    
-   {Obstacle3}
    

And by {Date}, they almost chose to give up.

**THE BREAKTHROUGH:**

Until one day, {MomentOfChange}.

As the story goes, {Story}.

And the rest is history.

**THE ACHIEVEMENT:**

Between {Date} and {Date}, {ThoughtLeader} went on to:

-   {Achievement1}
    
-   {Achievement2}
    
-   {Achievement3}
    

Maybe most importantly, they {Achievement4}.

**THE LESSON:**

I love {ThoughtLeader}’s story because it represents {LifeLesson}.

It reminds us of the power of {Habit1}, {Habit2}, and {Habit3}, compounded over time.

Because when we focus on the right things, where we’re headed is certain.

We just need the future to catch up.

The most {Status} {Person/Company} of the last {X} {Time} is {Name}.

But back in {Date}, {Person/Company} shared their {X} rules for {Topic}. And these rules are a must-read for {Audience1}, {Audience2}, and {Audience3} who want to {Outcome}. (If you haven’t read this yet, get ready—because this is one of those rare gems on the Internet.)

Here’s the breakdown:

**Rule #1: {Rule1}**

{Person/Company} reminds us that what people care about isn’t {Myth}.

It’s actually {RealAnswer}. Because {Reason1}, {Reason2}, and {Reason3}. We all know these things “in theory,” we just forget them in the moment.

You have to actively remind yourself what matters most.

**Rule #2: {Rule2}**

Most people who try to {Outcome} think {Myth}.

When actually, it’s usually the opposite. And the reason is because {Reason}. So, don’t fall into the trap most people do.

{RepeatRule2}

**Rule #3: {Rule3}**

It takes people a long time to learn this one.

Success is not about {WrongAnswer}. Instead, it’s about practicing {Rule3} over and over again—until one day, you achieve {Outcome}.

**Rule #4: {Rule4}**

This one is my favorite.

Whether you are a {Audience1}, {Audience2}, or {Audience3}, this rule still applies. You have to {RepeatRule4} to achieve {Outcome}.

And usually makes all the difference.

**Rule #5: {Rule5}**

This is true for most things in life.

Your goal should not be to {WrongOutcome}. Instead, you should be more concerned with {RightOutcome}.

Then, and only then, will you follow in the footsteps of the most {Status} {Person/Company} ever.

# {X} Controversial Opinions On {Topic} 99% Of The World Agrees With—But I Do Not

I have been interested in {Topic} for a long time.

And over the past {NumberOfYears}, I have come across a lot of strong opinions about {Topic} that, at first I agreed with, and then the more I learned and educated myself the more I disagreed with. Until eventually, I reached a point where I felt like the only reason these beliefs had become mainstream and commonly accepted was because “a lot of other people” agreed with them too.

So, I have some controversial opinions I’d like to share on {Topic} after {X} hours immersing myself in the subject:

1.  **{StrongOpinion1}**
    

I’m not saying {SubtleDistinction}.

I’m just saying {ClarifyingStatement}.

2.  **{StrongOpinion2}**
    

Contrary to popular belief, {ClicheAction} is a myth.

-   {FailureExample1}
    
-   {FailureExample2}
    
-   {FailureExample3}
    

{ClicheAction} is a fast-track to {UndesirableOutcome}.

3.  **{StrongOpinion3}**
    

“Most people” do what “most people” do.

Which leads to…

-   {NegativeStat1}
    
-   {NegativeStat2}
    
-   {NegativeStat3}
    

Clearly what “most people do” doesn’t work.

So do something else.

4.  **{StrongOpinion4}**
    

99% of the time, this is a giant mistake.

Instead, {Name} has a great framework for achieving {Outcome} without falling into {Trap}.

-   {Step1}
    
-   {Step2}
    
-   {Step3}
    

5.  **{StrongOpinion5}**
    

Pursuing {Outcome} is a silly goal.

Because {UnconventionalReason}.

{DifferentOutcome} is a better pursuit in life.

# The Wild Story Of How {Person/Company} Achieved {UnexpectedOutcome}

According to {Source}, {Person/Company} has officially reached {GiantOutcome}.

But here’s what you probably don’t know: When {Person/Company} first started back in {Date}, they had {NoOutcome}. But just a few {Time} later, they {FirstBigOutcome}.

How did this happen? {Twist}

Here’s the story:

**The Very Beginning**

{Person/Company}’s story begins in {Date}, {SpecificDetail}.

{UnexpectedAnecdote}.

And while there, {Person} wasn’t even trying to {Outcome}. So, they spent their time trying to find success doing random things like:

-   {Experience1}
    
-   {Experience2}
    
-   {Experience3}
    

Until one day, everything changed.

**The Moment Of Change**

{MomentOfChange}.

It was {Date} and {Name} became the first {Status}.

They saw this as an opportunity—and took it.

Their gameplan:

-   {Tactic1}
    
-   {Tactic2}
    
-   {Tactic}
    

As you can probably guess: it worked.

**The Pinnacle Of Success**

By {Date}, {Person} had risen to a wild level of success—way beyond they probably ever thought possible for themselves.

-   {Outcome1}
    
-   {Outcome2}
    
-   {Outcome3}
    

And the rest is history.

I love this story because it is the perfect encapsulation of what it takes to achieve {Outcome}, but also shows how in order to be “lucky,” you need to put yourself in a position to receive luck.

Great reminder for anyone with big dreams.

A good {Role} can {GoodOutcome}.

A bad {Role} can {BadOutcome}.

Curated Takeaways

LinkedIn Post

{Name} is the {Status} of {Topic}.

But most people don’t know how they got there.

After binging over {X} {Assets} of theirs to study how, here’s what I learned:

-

Some quick stats on {Name} if you're unfamiliar:

-   {AchievementStat1}
    
-   {AchievementStat2}
    
-   {AchievementStat3}
    
-   {AchievementStat4}
    

So... what can we learn?

-

{Name} creates {Assets} with this simple, 3-part framework:

1) {Step1}

2) {Step2}

3) {Step3}

Now, pair this framework with an unmatched work ethic and you get a potent combination for rapid growth.

Let's dig in:

-

For {Name}, everything begins with {Step1}.

The reason is because {Reason}.

To do this, {Name} does the following:

-   {Tactic1}
    
-   {Tactic2}
    
-   {Tactic3}
    

Simple, but highly effective.

-

The next thing {Name} focuses on is {Step2}.

They do this by {Tactic}, and sometimes even {Tactic}.

Which leads us to…

-

The real reason {Name} is so successful at {Outcome} is because they are obsessive about:

-   {Tactic}
    
-   {Tactic}
    
-   {Tactic}
    

This, combined with {Step1} and {Step2} is what makes them so successful.

-

So, let's recap what we've learned:

First, study {Step1}. And remember to {DescriptionStep1}.

Second, study the art of {Step2}. Do this by:

1) {Tactic1}

2) {Tactic2}

3) {Tactic3}

And lastly, don't {Mistake}. Instead, {Step 3}. And don’t forget to {DescriptionStep3}.

Do the above, and maybe you will be the next {Status} of {Topic}!

Industry Insights

The {Niche} industry is on fire.

Some stats that will blow your mind:

1. {Stat1}

2. {Stat2}

3. {Stat3}

But it’s not until you break each of these down that you realize how quickly the {Niche} industry is really growing:

-

1. {Stat1}

This is an impressive stat at face value.

But what’s 10x more impressive is {SecondaryStat}.

That’s {X} times bigger than {ComparableIndustry}.

This is a signal of where things might be headed.

-

2. {Stat2}

The last time an industry saw growth like this, it was in {Date} when {Niche} was {Outcome}.

I’m betting the same thing will happen again here.

-

3. {Stat3}

As if the above wasn’t impressive enough, this stat is just mind-boggling.

To give you a sense of how big that is, that’s {EverydayComparison1}.

Or {EverydayComparison2}.

-

My guess?

{Niche} is going to eventually overtake {ComparableIndustry1} the same way {Niche} overtook {ComparableIndustry2}.

And at this rate, that will probably happen by {Date}.

All you need.

-

Lesson 3: {Lesson3}

When I was first starting out, I was so determined to achieve {X} that I deprived myself of {ShortTermOutcome}.

Career Mistakes

Thread

I asked {X} {Niche} leaders one simple question:

“What early career mistake will you never make again?”

The result: {X} profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.

Let’s dive in:

---

Mistake 1: {Mistake1}

Too often, {Role} choose to {WrongDecision}.

Instead, {Role} should be focused on {RightDecision}.

This is what ends up making the biggest difference.

---

Mistake 2: {Mistake2}

A good {Role} can {GoodOutcome}.

A bad {Role} can {BadOutcome}.

But a legendary {Role} can {GiantOutcome}.

---

Mistake 3: {Mistake3}

Until you’ve {Milestone}, don’t take your eye off the ball.

{”RelevantQuote”}.

---

Mistake 4: {Mistake4}

Traditional wisdom says {TraditionalWisdom}.

But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:

-   {RightDecision1}
    
-   {RightDecision2}
    

Then, {TraditionalWisdom} works great.

---

Mistake 5: {Mistake5}

We all think we can {Decision}.

Until we can’t.

Which is why it’s much better to {RightDecision} from the very beginning.

I started [doing X] when I was [Y years old].

Since then, I've...

• Accomplishment #1

• Accomplishment #2

• Accomplishment #3

• Accomplishment #4

If I had to do it all over again, here are 5 things I'd do differently.

Thing #1: Don't do X.

At the time, I thought [this] was a good idea.

Instead, I would do Y.

I really thought X was going to give me [the result].

It didn't.

Instead, I would do Y. Because I learned much later that Y...

• Does this

• Does this

• Does this

Thing #3: Do X, first.

One of my biggest mistakes was delaying X.

I shouldn't have.

If I had to do it all over again, I'd do X first. Because X is what unlocks:

• Outcome

• Outcome

• Outcome

---

Thing #4: Don't do X.

At the time, everyone told me to do X.

Boy, were they wrong.

Not only was X a huge waste of time, but it ended up causing me [problems 1, 2, 3].

I probably would have achieved [goal] if I had just avoided X to begin with.

---

Thing #5: Always remember Y.

It has taken me many years to realize Y is what matters.

Don't pay attention to X.

Don't feel the need to listen to Z.

Just focus on Y and the rest takes care of itself.

TL;DR: 5 things I'd do differently to achieve [outcome], faster.

• Thing 1
