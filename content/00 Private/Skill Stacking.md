Not only your specific knowledge is enough. It is in the intersection (or stack) of skills you accrue.

You don't need to be the best lawyer in the world.

You need to be a really good lawyer, with knowledge of the video game industry, and now no one can beat you in 'video game law'

This is a good argument for being a generalist. Need to [[balance depth & width]]
