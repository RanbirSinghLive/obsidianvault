# Theme: New vs Old Problems

Recovery
Pre-Covid
Process

# Problem Grouping:
- ## Communication Issues
	- Jazz STOC
		- How much experience do they have and are they all YYZ based?
		- Only able to forecast out 9 minutes without SOCC approval due to crewing impact. Can this be reviewed?
	- Jazz STOC/Workforce Planning
		- Manpower doesn't have gate view
		- Jazz doesn't have access to streamline
		- Jazz AOM & Workforce Manager should sit together
		- Right now flow goes Manpower>STOC  MGO>Jazz SOC/Conf Call>Jazz STOC
		- Hoping for Manpower>Jazz STOC
	- Jazz/Primeflight
		- Primeflight Groomer/Primeflight Manager/Jazz STOC/AC Gate
			- New vendors mean less robust processes
			- 3 phone calls if everything goes on time
	- Cancellation Notifications Lack Info
		- When was the cancellation actioned: date/time?
		- What departments were advised: STOC, Deployment, In-Terminal, Airside, Baggage (maybe a check mark of who)
		-   Who provided baggage guidance?
	- ACDM Benefit?
		- GTAA imposed flow control
		- Is there any material benefit to GTAA vs old process?
		- Just causes more micromanagement issues for AC
	- Jazz SOCC
		- Can delayed flights be reflected in the Fin’s track till end of day? Still see flights not reflecting expected delays going into the evening.
		- Forecast; Is there a disconnect in forecasting delays and available planned crews between Jazz SOC / STOC & MPR? If so, how can it be made better?
	- Crew Scheduling
		- What are the timelines that Crew Sked has to notify STOC about Crewing issues? How far out?
- ## Disused Processes
	- Gate Control
		- AC mainline used to have control over Domestic gating, Advance Planning & close coordination with SOC over fin changes
		- Now left to be a tow planner only
		- Jazz STOC says they have to make multiple call’s to GTAA about RTG’s and tows vs before the change where they made an announcement and STOC gate planner actioned it.
	- IOCC no longer manned
	- Static Gating
		- Increased situational awareness
		- Increased collaboration
		- Familiarization with Regional product
	- Gate/Slot Approval Process
	- Jazz-only Workforce Planner
		- Now Jazz is bigger in YYZ vs 2019
	- Delay Coding
		- Delay coding has gone from an internal source of the truth to primarily focused on APPR
	- GSE
		- Jazz STOC indicated Tow Bars, Coolers and Push Back tractors are an ongoing issue
		- Resolution - Does Jazz , GSE & ACS have calls prior to start-up and again going into the evening to review shortages and plan which if any will take a hit?
		- What are the numbers of GSE vs planned peak flight schedule times?
	- Ramp Oversight
		- Is there dedicated management oversight in these areas ? 
		- Jazz STOC sends an overnight report pre head start advising what Fin is on what gate for start-up. 
		- Resolution - Does overnight Manager ensure staging for head start flights?
		- Setting up coolers, staging GSE, close doors secure aircraft
		- Does Jazz STOC view CCTV prior to startup to ensure all GSE is in place?
	- Ramp
		- Only 1 wing walker on Jazz flights. Is this the historic norm?
		- Often observed crew compliment of 1 lead + 1 trainee
			- Sees like all he work falling on one EE to dispatch flights throughout the day
- ## Experience & Decision Making
	- Average seniority of ramp employee much lower
	- Primeflight new workforce
		- Head start flights: When no STOC coordinator for Prime. STOC says they don’t answer the phone. Multiple calls wasting STOC time. Rude when answered
		- Why are overnight flights on the gate not groomed already & security sealed?
		- Why is their shift turnover at peak time 14:00? 
		- Solutions:
			- Pull delays to see if there are times of day they take more delays and is there a correlation.
			- Prime Manager before start up and again prior to PM operations should touch base with Jazz STOC , how many groomers, drivers, vehicles?
	- Tow Constraints
		- Tractors left at the Terminal vs the Hanger. Who oversees Tractor setup?
		- Has this been addressed where AC has had to help with towing in peak times?
	- Workforce Planning
		- Do the amount of crews meet peak requirements and if so, what is the factor / room for delays? 
		- Does Jazz advise MPR which ones are head start flights? 
		- How does Jazz communicate delays to MPR? 
		- Do MPR Coordinators have Gate View access & training?
	- Jazz STOC
		- Training: Talking to Jazz STOC there would be a great benefit in further training.
		- They have no to little knowledge of where the ITPC or SPIL vs PIL (passenger information lounge)
		- Also have them cross train with AC STOC Managers (who undergo much more training) & Deployment Managers
	- Deplaning:
		- Message that pax can deplane without skycheck cart ready?
	- Ramp 

# Jazz STOC
- consolidate with AC?

# Slide on Levels of Abstraction by Work Group
- Crewing
	- Level 1 - Pairings, FTDT
	- Level 2 - Reserve
	- Level 3 - Resiliency
- Ground Staff
	- Level 1 - Gantt, whitespace
	- Level 2 - Headcount
	- Level 3 - Productivity


01AUG22:

- Plane 167 broken - call to the gate to let them know changes coming, but agent wants more info before she advises passengers
- 8715 - RTG MTC issue - LH angle of attack issue
	- Fin 729, part of flight strings
	- L/H AOA vane replaced due to AOA vane heat caution. 729 RTS

- Since I sat down I've seen 2 RTGs for MTC
- Also a plane have to deplane due to overwing fueling
- Load has a lot of last minute requests for ballast bags




- [GTAA just doing file & fly
- i.e. 7 runway slots but only 6 Code E gates, they will approve 7 slots & the 7th flights will hold for gate
- SI - approved without guarantee of gate

# Jazz Operations:

John Walker/ Conain
- Both CSMs 8 months sen combined
- No Jazz bid positions on ramp. Just surplus
- Delay coding planning vs performance
- Sales and Ramp on same freq is not working
- 1 Jazz ramp manager vs 3 mainline. What is the frequency comparison?
- What is the ATW/BTW compare AC vs Jazz?
- Sequence: Ramp asked if it is a connecting bag? It is but STOC can't confirm where it's coming from. This delays the sequence
- This was for the flight to CLE
- 8743 - no ramp crew at 1657. No pilots
- Then delayed to 1915 for crew
- Biggest takeaway from frontline is radios
- 8855 - ramp done way early. Miscom between sales and IFS to start boarding. Just started boarding 1718.
- Spoke stations hog ballast bags and causes issues. Causes delays
- 8981 - missing 35 bags 35 mins from departure. Are we holding?
- Spent multiple trips around airport looking for equipment
- Not any time to coach. And these managers don't have any more time on the job then the employees

## 04AUG:

Apparently we Cancelled flt last night 8927/03 aug

Pax are telling Dean that they were told bags to be transferred and the bags scanned page in CM shows significant not scanned!  No idea where these are..

Has a communication gone to staff on the initiative of delays being forecasted min+20?
Might be a good idea to advertise?

Static gating or F gates leads: can cross utilise staff better when deployment not seeing picture on the ground. I.E. 3 flights. 2 delayed & third ready to board without assist, move 1 agent over to board


Note

Dean comments;
2 channels for jazz shoud be split due radio ettiquette

One ramp and one sales
Jazz domestic shud be sales and tb shud be ramp
Lead required at F customer service desk.  
Jazz idiosyncrasies.. jazz COB some dont need small bin airplanes. 
Agt called jazz told story,  then jazz calls and asks agent question already told. Communication in stoc


## Dwayne:
8784  on a lengthy delay, Jazz coordinator came at my desk to advise crew duty issues on the flight 20 min to departure. I then asked him, How would I protect this flight if we had staffing issues. After explaining to him that they should be calling their OPS to get a critical flight list so we can be better prepared, The jazz stoc coordinator advised that I should speak with Danny(I had no time for that).  I escalated to MGO and this was the response he got ….


What is the ratio of mgr/ee? Vs 2019.
No yellow pass indicator in streamline

GTAA - waits 60 mins until bus ops activation for gate hold. Are we equipped with a quicker response time?

Bryan S - higher % of senior EEs on vacation in JUL/AUG, compounds the problem
- “En route” – language used (observation), what does this mean? ETA for crew arrival is more meaningful. One hour arrival time observed
- Inside vs outside agent “I don’t have a vest” static vs dynamic crews
- S0 CSM on ramp AC Mainline calls QK to advise 3 out of 4 towbars for CRJ were at GSE and u/s.  AC STOC calls GSE who confirms 2 out of the 3 u/s were outside gate 168 awaiting pickup. QK STOC advised CSM 2 other tow bards serviceable and ready for pickup.  AC Area CSM to check with GSE serviceability prior to raising alarm.
- QK8865 MCI, new agent had not worked in this USA gates area previously.  Dd not have a vest to go outside and did not know who his ramp assist was.  He also did not know to scroll down on the PDA to determine ramp assist.  Ramp assist arrived and was good, helped new agent.  QK flight crew arrived on time, walk around. Aircraft at gate and ready, bags loaded quickly, boarding smooth and on time.  Flight took a 10min delay for late finals call-in at 32min past the hour.
- IAH gate hold for 2 hours - late fin swap but could have been improved by better coordination with RMU
- Mobile bridge adapter - gap on placement - bridge hood open - ramp issue
- 

## Jazz Stoc Experience:

2019: 5FT/5PT FT were over 1 yr, PT 3/5 over 1 year
2022: 10FT/4PT (hiring) FT: 3/10 over 1 year, PT: 2/4 over 1 year

2019: 80% over 1 year
2022: 36% over 1 year

Tow Crew:
2019: 12FT - all over 1 yr 10PT - 7 over 1 year
2022: 12FT (hiring 4 more) - 9/12 over 1 year
8PT - 2/8 over 1 year

2019: 86% over 1 year
2022: 55% over 1 year



## Cancel flow:
- Jazz cancels for crew, PMX advised, SOC cancels, pro unclear
- Making pro apparent prior to cancel - like mainline

Improvements:
Current State:
Tow data is manual, ad hoc, non-standardized between coordinators. No measurements retrievable
Quick Win:
Adopt Jazz YVR flight watch solution of tow log
End State:
Go paperless akin to AC

Ops Best Practices Process
- Find evangelists at both groups
- Leverage ECX

Improve overnight discipline

Jazz Tow Log:
119 lines of data over 4.5 days
55: had tow times, others did not
