When my mother's visa was ready to take her to Canada, dad sent it to her ancestral village, and not to his village where mum was. He was worried his parents wouldn't give it to her as they were on his case to remarry now that his market value had increased from becoming naturalized in Canada. He was adamant he was going to bring the girl he married to Canada.

November 3 1987:
On the eve that before my mother's departure to Delhi from the village, two local police officers showed up at their front door to 'make an inquiry about her passport.' My grandfather told them to get lost. They said 'it's two of us who've shown up here'

Sherri took Bapu aside and said 'just give them 100 rupees so they can get drunk'

That was the world my mum was leaving. It was once last reminder before leaving.
