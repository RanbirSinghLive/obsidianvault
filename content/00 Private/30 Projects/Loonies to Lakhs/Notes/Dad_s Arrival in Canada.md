April 1981 Family Net Worth: $10

My dad arrived on Vaisakhi. British Airways into Toronto. $9500 rupees.

My mom came in 1987. Dad PR in 1986.

Arrived with $10 and a visitor visa. With 2 cousins.

Lived with a cousin in an apartment. 2 bedrooms - 6 people

Started working right away. One day at a farm but it was too hard. He had only drove a truck in India. No hard labour.

His cousin was leaving a factory run by one Punjabi and one white, and put in a word for dad. He said bring him and show me.

Dad worked 7 days a week for 12 hours and sometimes slept there. He worked for $3 an hour. The owner brought him food and whiskey some nights.

Then the owners split the company. 

My mom recently reminded me of a memory. When I got my car I asked him where he wanted to go. He wanted to see his first job. He showed me the warehouse and the bank across the street where he deposited his cheque.

He worked on someone else's social insurance card and told the boss. He would deposit it in the bank account of his cousin.

My mum said to go inside but he said hed come back another time. He never did.

Dad was on layoff in then. Approx 2006 or 2008 and I had just got my first car. We had just applied for his layoff paperwork. 

On the way home mum saw hiring at Rona. We went inside to apply and they had a paper application. I started working there. They had math questions.

It was my first job with q uniform and I needed an interview.

When the factory split, the owner said if you stick with me I can make this factory work. Dad needed work so he stayed.
He started giving him 3.50 on his own.he worked there until 1986.

What he did: the metal grill in front fireplaces and grills inside stoves. He welded, painted pur bares to the ground. He also built stove burners. The grills on his cousins stove were made by him.

In 1986 his cousin said he could get him in Canac for $6 per hour.

When he left he flagpoled at the border (explain what that is).

He never told the guy he left, he just ghosted the factory boss and never saw him again.

When mum arrived. His net worth: $22,000 in his cousins account. And he booked a new construction in Mississauga. 5,000 deposit. Total equity of $15,000.

Mum and dad lived in a basement. 

When we saw the ships in old port he told me another way people got in the country.

He arrived in the same building and passed there. He began and ended his life in Canada in the same building.
