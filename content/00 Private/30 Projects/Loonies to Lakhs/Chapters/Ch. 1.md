The worst day of your life can always be beat. For me, this day would hold that record for the next 13 years.

Working at the renovation store meant waking up at 4:30 to sub-zero temperatures. It meant chipping ice off the windshield of my 1988 Toyota Corolla, parked at the far end of my condominium parking lot. I'd just recently learned I no longer needed to get it emissions tested as it was now old enough to be considered a collector's item. 

The car's wheels had a habit of whistling for the first few kilometres in cold weather. It sounded a like a train leaving the station as I left the lot. There were two speed bumps to traverse on the way out to the street. I got over the first one only paying the price of a miscellaneous crunch somewhere in the rear end. Normal.

It was on the second speed bump that the muffler fell off.

It was going to be inevitable. A 21 year old car whose underbelly looked like the inside of an unclean oven was going to have a critical failure somewhere. 

The issue was I had a shift to get to.

The car was still running just 'fine.' I knelt down and had a peak. It looked as if the only thing broken was the coupling that held the muffler exhaust pipe to the end of the car. Luckily, I had a bungee rope that I wrapped around the pipe and clipped into the hooks inside the trunk. The closed the trunk gently and made sure the integrity of the bungee cord wasn't compromised.

I was good to go.

Those days I was usually the first to get to the store from my department. I was in charge of opening the lock on the shipping yard and receiving the first few customers before the manager got in. It was the most responsibility I had been given at a job until that point. I felt it was a lot to bestow on a guy you were only willing to pay minimum wage.

Lately, there were rumours of widespread theft at the store. Security was lax and inventory was going missing at an increased rate. Toilets, vanities, pallets of flooring tiles, all allegedly vanishing without a trace.

That morning management was going to take action.

I got sent home a couple of hours after opening up the shipping yard. I was to be called to come back in for a meeting a few days later. I had zero doubt I would be fired at that meeting.

I walked back to my car with that feeling where the bottom of your heart is open like a car window, with air rushing in and out. I got asked about it by someone on the way out the parking lot.

"Did you do it?"

"No" I replied.

My father had lost his union job of 20 years the previous summer. [[check this]] He was currently back working for minimum wage at a warehouse. My mother hadn't worked in 10 years due to her worsening arthritis. I was in University nearing completion of a Sociology degree. It was actually like I was completing two degrees. My childhood best friend has been in 90% of my classes over the last three years. Through his dependency on me and mine on him, I had written all of his assignments and tutored him for all of our tests. I was exhausted from all-nighters. I had no clear prospects afterward graduation, except a faint notion of grad school as something I was 'supposed to do.' 

I now had just lost my job and our only car in the course of a morning.

I couldn't go home. Instead, I drove to the supermarket near our apartment. I bought a snack sized bag of Doritos and a bottle of soda, I don't remember which one. I was overweight from a diet similar to this throughout my life. The only physical activity I got was loading 2x4s into the back of contractors' pick-up trucks. I didn't like how I looked or how I spoke in public. Now I would be considered a thief by all the colleagues I had worked with for the past two years.

I sat on the curb in the strip mall parking lot next to my shitty car. I ate, drank and cried.

How did I get here? How did *we* get here? We being my family. As a second generation immigrant, I'm probably more tuned to thinking of our collective state than my personal state when it comes to failure and success. That has problems, but we're not there yet.

What decisions had compounded to bring us to our collective lowest point in life? Why was I more stressed out than my parents on how little we were making?

It turned out that this situation was trivial compared to things my parents had dealt with in their Canadian journey up until that point.

It also turned out that this would be a major setback, but also the *clean slate* I needed to drastically change the trajectory of my life.

I was part of an intergenerational financial story that was still being written then, and is turning towards a new chapter now. Our family's net worth has at least doubled in that time. I now make 10x [[check this]] what I made back then. We went from renting a one bedroom to owning a 6 bedroom triplex. I went from unemployed to a senior manager at a major airline. I went from a socially anxious loner to a happily married man with a circle of friends I can be myself around. This book is the story of all that, and how I reconciled two competing paradigms encompassing my personal, professional and relational life.

In her 2022 budget address, Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland called Canada's affordable housing crisis as 'intergenerational injustice.' With the threat of climate change, a declining life expectancy in the US, widening wealth inequality and housing becoming permanently out of reach for many, we are facing the probability of the first generation of many who won't take it as a given that their lives will be marketedly better than their parents.

In the midst of this intergenerational mobility uncertainty, immigrants have come to to signify the archetypal story of each generation surpassing the last. The fact remains that while the west may be stagnating on some metrics, more people across the developing world are being lifted out of poverty each day. More of those people will be enfranchised to find a way to the west in hopes of further betterment. If Canada is stagnating, it is doing so close to the top of the international hierarchy and more people than ever want in.

With native born Canadians not having enough babies to meet the population replacement rate, immigration will be relied on to keep Canada in a growth state. 

With this book, I hope to show that the path of generational financial progress is not a straight line. Some tensions exist from an integration and skill-market fit for new immigrants. For 2nd gens, desire for more complete integration comes at the balance of reconciling how much you want to preserve your ancestral identity. I'm at the precipice of fatherhood, and must now think about how 3rd gens interact with this dynamic. This book focuses on the financial aspect, but trust my concerns will be holistic for my potential future kids.

My story finds me at 20, a quarter into my productive lifespan, but it's later in my life's story than that. I trace this origins of my financial journey with the arrival of my father in Canada 8 years before my birth. True immigration is the closest we're able to see a family at it's beginning. True, immigrants had a life back home, but especially before the days of modern digital connection, they left most of it behind to be here. When my father arrived, his village had one working telegram operation and infrequent postal service.

I always like to look at my experience in the greater scheme of history as it immediately provides perspective and humility. Me crying in that parking lot, I lost perspective on what it meant in the greater scheme of *my family's* history.

I was having a bout of bad luck, in rapid succession. However, luck is just a more mystical aura we put around the concept of chance, and humans are really bad at understanding chance. 

Let's assume that luck is a favourable outcome of a 50/50 coin toss. Let's also assume that the outcome we want is tails. If the first toss of a coin lands on heads, what are the changes the next flip will be tails?

Despite what many think, the change is still 50/50. Even if the coin lands on heads 5 times in a row, it is now 'due' to land tails. 

Having the coin land heads, or a string of bad lucks in other words, can run longer than we can predict. On the flipside, things going you way in rapid succession has an equivalent change when left up to chance.

The goal in life is to leave as little up to chance as possible. However, some stuff will still be at the mercy of a flip of the cosmic coin. When that is so, we need to foster resilience (financial, mental, corporate) to sustain a string of back flips until we get good flips, and the good comes back eventually.
