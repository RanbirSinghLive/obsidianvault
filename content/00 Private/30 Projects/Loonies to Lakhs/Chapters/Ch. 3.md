Mum flew BA as well connecting through London

Arrived November 4 1987

Goodon, bapu and rani came via bus to drop her off at Delhi.

They carried their suitcases on their heads from the stand to the airport checkin. Bapu didn't like paying for things.

First time on plane: nerves overcome by seeing dad soon. 

Net worth: $22,000 in Gurdevs account.

Lived on Bulbourne street in house with gurdev, wife 2 kids.

Light snowfall next morning.

Dad dropped her off and seldom saw her again. He lived with another friend instead of staying put. 

Dad bought furniture and kept it in a cousins basement, ready to be used. 

Gurdevs wife took her to thr store to buy house supplies. My mum was shy to carry brooms and mops as in india she used a choora and only men held long sticks.

Kept stockpiling things at the house.

Forced dad to go live in the basement he was paying rent on. He dropped his suitcase off and left again. He always wanted to be surrounded by friends. He went back to the friend.

Mum asked him to stay home. She sat infront of the door, so he said he was going to check out the garden. He jumped over the fence to escape instead.

Mum started working after a week. First job was a sewing job making sweaters, tishirts, pants.

A few letters came in but dad always screened them.

One person said to adopt her son. Poojas munda

One said to bring her as a care worker since mum was pregnant.

My mamas came in 1988 sponsored by mum.
