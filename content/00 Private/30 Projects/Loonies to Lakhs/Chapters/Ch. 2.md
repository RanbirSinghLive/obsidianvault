Date: April 1981
Family Net Worth: $10

My dad arrived in Toronto on a day in April. It was Vaisakhi, the preeminent Sikh religious holiday, coinciding with the traditional harvest season in Punjab. He's always been a nervous flying, preferring only to take legacy European Airlines like Lufthansa, rather than sketchy, cheaper Russian or Indian ones. On his inaugural ride he took British Airways at a cost of 9,500 rupees one way.

Based on the historical [[CADINR]] exchange rates that was 9500x6.96.

That must've cleaned out his savings and whatever grandpa was willing to chip in, because he only had $10 CAD cash in his pocket when he got off the plane. In a financial journey, $10 net worth might as well be $0, and its as good as you get to the beginning so it makes things easy for me.

These days, there's all sorts of controls for an Indian to get to Canada. You can come on a student visa and hope to stay long term. You can come on the point system. You can be sponsored by your spouse. There's an entire industry of Indian immigration consultants that this is sustaining.

Back in the day, these hurdles didn't exist. Dad came here with a simple tourist visa as Canada and India were both part of the Commonwealth. That's it. 

My dad has remarked that if people in India only new how easy it was back then, thry would've come in millions. Who knows what stopped word from traveling.

Dad arrived with two 'cousins' from his village. We call them 'pindus' in Punjabi These are people not blood-related to you, but they live in the same village, which kind of makes them close enough to kin. When arranged marriages are set up in India, they pick partners one village removed at least. The best fit for this relationship in English is cousin so we run with it.

Punjabis tend to upgrade relations one notch above how they're regarded in English.

I remember a classmate trying to describe the relation with his cousin (by blood) and settled on the term cousin-brorher being more apt.


My mom came in 1987. Dad PR in 1986.

Lived with a cousin in an apartment. 2 bedrooms - 6 people

Started working right away. One day at a farm but it was too hard. He had only drove a truck in India. No hard labour.

His cousin was leaving a factory run by one Punjabi and one white, and put in a word for dad. He said bring him and show me.

Dad worked 7 days a week for 12 hours and sometimes slept there. He worked for $3 an hour. The owner brought him food and whiskey some nights.

Then the owners split the company. 

My mom recently reminded me of a memory. When I got my car I asked him where he wanted to go. He wanted to see his first job. He showed me the warehouse and the bank across the street where he deposited his cheque.

He worked on someone else's social insurance card and told the boss. He would deposit it in the bank account of his cousin.

My mum said to go inside but he said hed come back another time. He never did.

Dad was on layoff in then. Approx 2006 or 2008 and I had just got my first car. We had just applied for his layoff paperwork. 

On the way home mum saw hiring at Rona. We went inside to apply and they had a paper application. I started working there. They had math questions.

It was my first job with q uniform and I needed an interview.

When the factory split, the owner said if you stick with me I can make this factory work. Dad needed work so he stayed.
He started giving him 3.50 on his own.he worked there until 1986.

What he did: the metal grill in front fireplaces and grills inside stoves. He welded, painted pur bares to the ground. He also built stove burners. The grills on his cousins stove were made by him.

In 1986 his cousin said he could get him in Canac for $6 per hour.

When he left he flagpoled [[flagpoling]] at the border (explain what that is).

He never told the guy he left, he just ghosted the factory boss and never saw him again.

When mum arrived. His net worth: $22,000 in his cousins account. And he booked a new construction in Mississauga. 5,000 deposit. Total equity of $15,000.

Mum and dad lived in a basement. 

When we saw the ships in old port he told me another way people got in the country.

He arrived in the same building and passed there. He began and ended his life in Canada in the same building.
