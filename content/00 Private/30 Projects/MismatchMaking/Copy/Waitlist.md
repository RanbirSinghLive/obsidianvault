Bubbles are boring. 

Today's world makes us dismiss conflicting news, views and people.

At the same time, social networks allow us to connect via seemingly unlimited friend requests, right swipes and DMs. However, more ends up feeling like less. This paradox of choice often overwhelms and paralyzes us.

The net result is strictly consuming and communicating with what's familiar.

This is not a recipe for growth. 

It's time to let a new voice enter your echo chamber.

Mismatchmaking asks you to paint an honest picture of yourself. I will then facilitate an email introduction to your 'mismatch.' A real person who differs from you in many ways but is also looking for a connection.

Mismatchmaking is not a dating or networking service. It is a connection service. If your connection grows into a friend, business partner or life partner, that's just a bonus worth bragging about!

We learn best when we meet someone new and reconcile their truth with our own. Be civil, generous and a little bit uncomfortable. If so, you're doing it right.
