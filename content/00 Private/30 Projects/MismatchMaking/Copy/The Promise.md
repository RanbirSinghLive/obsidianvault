Hi, I'm Ranbir.

  

I've spent my life connecting with diverse groups of people, many of whom disagree with me on fundamental things.

  

Now I'm here to be your matchmaker, or more precisely, your *mismatchmaker*. I offer a simple service: tell me about yourself and I will personally introduce you to someone who is also looking to make a connection but differs from you on many fronts.

  

They could be urban if you're rural, Ethiopian if you're Dutch, or a farmer if you're a lawyer.

  

The point is to step outside of your comfort zone and learn from each other's perspectives!
