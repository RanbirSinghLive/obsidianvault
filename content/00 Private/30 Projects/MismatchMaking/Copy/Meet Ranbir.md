Hello again!

  

I've been a fish out of water for most of my life:

  

I grew up as a Punjabi kid in 1990's Toronto.

  

I entered a career in Aviation at a time when very few of my colleagues looked like me.

  

I've traveled to dozens of countries. Along the way, I've been the first in-person interaction with a Sikh person for many new friends.

  

I moved as an anglophone to French Canada in my 20s.

  

Continually stepping out of my comfort zone and finding commonality with my peers has done wonders for me.

  

It has strengthened certain values, questioned others, and helped me to continually grow.

  

Let me help you do the same.
