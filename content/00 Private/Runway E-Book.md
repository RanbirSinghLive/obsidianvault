**The Thesis:** [[Corporate jobs]] are an overlooked, un-romanticized pathway towards attaining financial independence and leverage. By using basic financial modelling and a critical mindset, we can [[leverage]] corporate jobs to provide value, live integrally and achieve what we want to in life.

**Realizing that time is the most finite resource breeds impatience. Concentrating your finite time on something impactful requires patience. It's not easy to reconcile this.** 

I really like learning and reading and writing. I'm not trying to work corporate to then start a business. I want to be creative full time at some point, with no pressure to make money.

- everyone is told to start a business these days
- People don't want corporate job because it's considered boring, but it's what the market wants to hire
- First rule of business is to listen to the market.
- If the market wanted corporate jobs, leverage it
- Rat dqlio - the big cycle of life
