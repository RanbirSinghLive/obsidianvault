[[John Truby]] [[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft 

- story is much bigger than plot
- story is all of the subsystems of the story body working together
- plot is the under-the-surface weaving of various lines of action or sets of events so that the story builds steadily from begining to end
- it tracks the dance between hero & all oppos as they fight for the same goal
- its a combo of what happens and how those events are revealed to audience
- your plot depends on how you withhold & reveal information
- the masterful management of suspense & mystery

Organic Plot
- plot is any sequence of events
- an organic plot shows the actions that lead to the hero's char change or explain why that change is impossible
- each of the events is casually connected & essential
- Each action is proportionate in its length & pacing
- The amount of plotting seems to come naturally from the hero rather than imposed by the author
- plot should be appropriate to hero's desire & ability to plan & act

Plot Types:
- contradiction: plot is designed but must feel natural
- two legs: take action & learn information

The Journey Plot:
- From myth, hero defeats opponents in succession

The 3 Unities Plot:
- time, place & action
- story takes place in 24 hours in one location & follows 1 story line

The Reveals Plot:
- Hero stays in 1 place, even a city
- can cover up to a few years
- decades turns into a saga & journey plot
- key technique: hero familiar with opponents, but a lot abot them is hidden from the hero & audience
- oppos very skilled at scheming to get what they want
- produces a plot that is filled with revelations for hero & audience
- oppo is char best able to attack hero, & when hero learns how those attacks occur, surprises come
- hero must then overcome his weakness & change or be destroyed
- "the big plot"

Antiplot:
- disdain for plotting
- plot expresses subteties of char
- ie. catcher in the rye
- techniques: POV, shifting narrators, branching story structure, nonchrono time
- aim is to show more complex view of human character

Genre Plot:
- not applicable - too formulaic

Multistrand Plot:
- The Wire

Creating An Organic PLot:
1. Do you want a storyteller?
2. Write structure in detail, using the 22 steps - will give you most plot beats
3. Decide if any genre applies and add appropriate beats i.e. coming of age

22 Steps:
1. Sell-revelation, need, and desire 
2. Ghost and story world  
3. Weakness and need  
4. Inciting event
5. Desire  
6. Ally or allies  
7. Opponent and/or mystery  
8. Fake-ally opponent  
9. First revelation and decision: Changed desire and motive
10. Plan  
11. Opponent's plan and main counterattack  
12. Drive  
13. Attack by ally  
14. Apparent defeat  
15. Second revelation and decision: Obsessive drive, changed desire and motive  
16. Audience revelation  
17. Third revelation and decision 
18. Gate, gauntlet, visit to death 
19. Battle  
20. Self-revelation  
21. Moral decision  
22. New equilibrium


**Novels have way more than 22 steps, as there are more revelations**

# Openings
- Ghost, story world, weakness, need & problem constitute the opening of story
- 3 kinds of openings:
	- Community Start
		- main char lives in a paradise world in harmony
		- hero has no gohst
		- vulnerable to attack
	- Running Start
		- strong ghost
		- lives in slavery, with serious weaknesses & multiple problems
		- use this one
	- Slow Start
		- bad, needs expert execution


1. Self-Rev, Need (Psych & Moral), Desire, Initial Error
	1. represent the overall range of change of your hero
	2. what will my hero learn at the end?
	3. what goes he know at the begining? no one is a blank slate
	4. what is he wrong about at the beginning?
2. Ghost & Story World
	1. Ghost
		1. a more specific term for backstory
		2. 2 two types - 1st is an event from the past that still haunts the hero
		3. an open wound that is source to pysh & moral wekaness
		4. a device that extends hero's development backwards
		5. 2nd type - hero's internal opponent - the great fear holding him back from action. The ghost acts as a counter-desire
		6. desire pushes him forward whereas ghost holds him back
	2. Story World
		1. where your hero lives
		2. an expression of hero's weaknesses, needs, desires & obstacles
		3. if hero is enslaved, story world should be enslaving in some way
3. Weakness & Need
	1. Weakness
		1. hero's one or more char flaws that are ruining his life
		2. psych & moral
	2. Need
		1. what the hero must fulfill in order to have a better life
	3. Problem
		1. crisis hero faces at story beginning
		2. aware of crisis but not solution
		3. outgrowth of weakness to quickly show the audience
4. Inciting Incident
	1. outside event that causes hero to make a goal & take action
	2. **small step except it connects need & desire**
	3. jump-start hero out of beginning paralysis & force him to act
	4. best: hero thinks he has just overcome the crisis he's faced since story beginning, but he's actually now in worst trouble of his life
5. Desire
	1. hero's particular goal
	2. provides the spine for the plot
	3. usually only one goal, started at a low level
	4. increase the importance of desire as the story progresses
	5. if you start desire too high, it cannot build - plot will feel flat
	6. increase intensity, not change desire
6. Ally or Allies
	1. Gained to help overcome opponent and reach the goal
	2. not simply a sounding board
	3. give the allies a desire line to show them as complete people
	4. ally should not be more interesting than the hero
	5. Subplot
		1. must affect the hero's main plot
		2. make sure they dovetail nicely, usually near the end
		3. subplot character usually not the ally
			1. they have 2 separate functions
			2. allies help in the main plot
			3. subplot chars drive a related plot to be compared to main plot
			4. focus on the 7 vs 22 steps for subplot as that's all you have time for
7. Opponent and/or Mystery
	1. oppo wants to prevent hero from reaching goal
	2. the best oppo is a necessary one
	3. the best able to attack the great weakness of the hero
	4. two main reasons oppo & mystery are closely related:
		1. A mysterious oppo is more difficult to defeat
		2. in good stories, hero has 2 part task: uncover the opponent & defeat him
		3. makes success far greater accomplishment
		4. - [ ] #task revelation that Saad is the real opponent
		5. 2nd main reason: in detective & thrillers, there must be a mystery to compensate for missing opponent
	5. The Iceberg opponent
		1. Think of oppo as an iceberg
		2. some is visible but most hidden below surface
		3. most dangerous part hidden
		4. 4 techniques
			1. create a hierarchy of oppos with a number of alliances
				1. all of oppos are related to one another
				2. they are related to one another
			2. hide the hierarchy from the hero & audience
				1. hide each oppos true desire
			3. Reveal all this info in peices & increasing pace
			4. consider an obvious oppo early on
				1. then attacks from hidden oppos, or hidden part of starting oppo
8. Fake-Ally Opponent
	1. appears to be ally but is oppo or working for main oppo
	2. plot is driven by reveals
	3. at every revelation, the plot 'turns'
9. First Revelation & Decision: Changed Desire & Motive
	1. a surprising new piece of info forces him to make a decision & move in a new direction
	2. has to adjust desire & motive
	3. motive is why the hero wants the goal
	4. all these must occur at the same time: revelation, decision, changed desire, changed motive
	5. the quality of your plot comes down to the quality of your revelations
	6. "the plot thickens"
	7. Technique: Added Revelations
		1. The more revelations you have, the richer & more complex the plot
10. Plan
	1. set of guidelines & strategies the hero will use to overcome the oppo & reach the goal
	2. be wary of hero simply playing out the plan
	3. makes things predictable
	4. initial plan always fails
	5. dig deep to a better strategy
	6. Technique: Training
		1. most heros already trained but most look inside themselves to confront weaknesses
		2. training important in certain genres
			1. sports, war, caper
	5. [x] #task apparent defeat when found out at job stealing ✅ 2023-01-01
11. Opponent's Plan & Main Counterattack
	1. Oppo also comes up with plan to get goal & begins to execute a line of attack against the hero
	2. Often overlooked
	3. more intricate & hidden opponent's plan, better the plot
12. Drive
	1. Series of actions the hero performs to defeat the oppo & win
	2. **Comprises biggest section of the plot**
	3. during drive, oppo usually too strong, so hero is losing, as a result he becomes desperate & starts taking immoral steps to win
	4. During the drive, you want plot development, not repetition. In other words, change the hero's action in a fundamental way. Don't keep hitting the same plot beat (action or event)
13. Attack by Ally
	1. during the drive, hero is losing to the oppo & getting desparate
	2. when he takes immoral steps, ally confronts him
	3. at the moment, ally becomes conscience of the hero
		1. I'm trying to help you but you're doing it wrong
	4. hero tries to defend his actions
	5. provides 2nd level of conflict
	6. increases pressure on hero & makes him question his values & actions
14. Apparent Defeat
	1. 66-75% of the way thru the story
	2. hero believes goal is lost & oppo has won. hero's lowest point
	3. should be devastating
	4. should have many setbacks but only one moment 'near death'
	3. [x] #task when the security guard gives him the defence? ✅ 2023-01-01
15. Second Revelation & Decision: Obsessive Drive, Changed Desire & Motive
	1. Just after apparent defear
	2. gets new piece of info that shows victory is still possible
	3. [x] #task when the security guard gives him the defence? ✅ 2023-01-01
	4. has galvanizing effect on the hero
	5. although strengthened by information, he is still continuing moral decline he began during the drive
	6. ensure all occur at this moment: revelation, decision, obsessive drive, changed desire, changed motive
16. Audience Revelation
	1. audience, but not the hero, learns an important piece of info
	2. often, audience learns true identity of fake-ally opponent
	3. provides exciting pop in what is often a slow section of the plot
	4. shows the reader the true power of the opposition
	5. puts distance between the hero & audience - allowing them to see hero's overall process of change
17. Third Revelation & Decision
	1. often when hero learns fake-ally opponent's true identity
	2. instead of backing out of the conflict, hero gets more determined because he sees all he is up against
18. Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to Death
	1. conflict escalates to get almost unbearable
	2. few options & must pass through a long gauntlet
	3. psychological visit to death
	4. sudden realization of his own mortality
	5. hero reasons that if his life is to have meaning, he must take a stand for what he believes
	6. most movable part of plot & can go in other parts of structure
19. Battle
	1. determines who, if anyone wins the goal
	2. should give clear expression of what each side is fighting for
	3. not which side have superior force but which ideas/values win out
	4. funnel point of the story, everything converges
	5. brings together all chars & lines of action
	6. occurs in smallest space possible
	7. hero usually fulfills his need & gains his desire
	8. where hero is most like his main opponent
		1. in that similarity, the crucial differences are clearer
	9. theme first explodes in the minds of the reader
	10. they see which way of acting is best
20. Self-Revelation
	1. after crucible, hero undergoes change
	2. if self-rev is moral as well as psych, the hero also learns the proper way to act  towards others
	3. should be sudden, shattering the her and new, something the hero dind't know about himself until that moment
	4. make sure what the hero learns about himself is truly meaningful - not just platitudes about life
	5. don't have the hero state it directly to the reader
	6. Double Reversal
		1. Give both the hero and the main opponent a weakness and a need.  
		2. Make the opponent human. That means, among other things, that he must be capable of learning and changing.
		3. During or just after the battle, give the opponent as well as the hero a self-revelation.  
		4. Connect the two self-revelations. The hero should learn something from the opponent, and the opponent should learn something from the hero.
		5. Your moral vision as the author is the best of what both characters learn
	
21. Moral Decision
	1. Once hero learns proper way to act, he must make a decision
	2. proof that the hero has learned something
	3. Thematic Revelation
		1. trick is to draw the abstract & the general from the real & specific of your char. Find a particular gesture or action that can have a symbolic impact on your audience
22. New Equilibrium
	1. everything goes back to noral with 1 big difference. Hero is at a higher level

Guidelines:
- Be flexible - not a fixed order or formula
- Beware of breaking the order

# Revelations Sequence:
- Separate the plot revels & look at them as a unit as a check/balance
- See if sequence builds properly
- must be logical, in order hero most likely will learn them
- build in intensity
- increasing pace
- most powerful is the reversal, everything in the story is turned on its head

# The Storyteller
- It's a choice to use one
- often misused due to not understanding the implications
- majority of novels don't use a recognizable storyteller but an omniscient one
- these stories are fast, with a strong desire line & big plot
- first or third person
- using recognizable storyteller allows you greater complexity & subtlety
- lets you present actions & commentary
- when you pick a teller, the reader immediately asks why him?
- calls attention to itself & can distance audience from story but allows the writer the benefit of detachment
- giving the story a voice is actually getting in the character's mind - blurs the line between reality & illusion
- storyteller is recounting what happened in the past, brings memory into play
	- gives feeling of loss, sadness & might have been-ness
	- adds a touch of wisdom
- if the storyteller asks us to trust them, we trust them less
- storyteller allows you to have huge gaps in time easier as it relies on memory
- don't use a storyteller & then stay chronological
- this is useless & a waste
- Techniques
	- Your storyteller is probably your true main character
		- splits the self-revelation in half
		- sees an external model of action & gains a profound insight that changes his life
	- Intro the storyteller in a dramatic situation
		- i.e. a fight has occurred or imp decision has been made
		- places teller within the story, creating suspense about the teller himself & gives tale a running start
	- find good trigger to cause him to tell the story
		- personally motivated by the story problem in the present
		- linked to why he;s telling this story now
		- [x] #task this relates to reason the story is told as a textbook. Implied Happy is a teacher now ✅ 2023-01-01
	- The teller show not be all-knowing at the start
		- god has no dramatic interest in the present
		- **instead, the teller should have a great weakness that'll be solved by telling the story & thinking back & telling the story should be a struggle for him**
	- Find a unique structure for telling the tale iso chronological
	- The teller should try diff versions of how he tells the story as he struggles to find & express the truth
	- Do not end the storytelling frame at the end of the stroy, but rather 3/4s of the way thru
		- leave room for recounting change to storyteller in present
	- The act of telling the story should lead the teller to self-rev
	- Consider having the storyteller explore how the act of telling the story can be immoral or destructive to himself or others
		- [x] #task use this storytelling technique ✅ 2023-01-01
	- The act of telling the story should be the final dramatic event
		- this is often the heros' moral decision
		- forces the storytelling hero to make a new moral decision
	- Don't promote the fallacy that a char's death allows the full & true story to be told
	- The deeper theme should be concerned with the truth & beauty of creativity, not heroic action
	- Be wary of too many storytellers

Genres:
- they all have their own rules

# Creating Your Plot—Writing Exercise 7

■ Designing Principle and Plot 
	Review the designing principle and the theme of your story. Be certain that your plot tracks these lines. 
■ Symbol for Plot 
	If you are using a story symbol, make sure that your plot is an expression of it.
■ Storyteller 
	Figure out if you want to use a storyteller, and if so, what kind. Keep in mind the structural techniques that allow you to get the most out of the storyteller.
■ Twenty-two Steps 
	Describe the twenty-two steps of your story in detail. Be sure to start with Step 1, the plot frame, so that all the other steps fall naturally into place.
■ Reveals Sequence 
	Focus on the reveals sequence. List the reveals separately from the other steps. Look for the following elements to make the reveals as dramatic as possible:
1. Make sure the sequence is logical.
2. Try to make each reveal more intense than the one before.
3. Check that each reveal causes your hero to change his original desire in some way.
4. Make the reveals come at a faster pace as you move toward the end of the story.
