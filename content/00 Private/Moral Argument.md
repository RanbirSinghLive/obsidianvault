[[John Truby]] [[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft 

- Good writers express their moral vision slowly and subtly, primarily through the story structure and the way the hero deals with a particular situation. 
- Your moral vision is communicated by how your hero pursues his goal while competing with one or more opponents and by what your hero learns, or fails to learn, over the course of his struggle.
- In effect, you, as the author, are making a moral argument through what your characters do in the plot. 

Theme Line: 
- Theme condensed in a single line
- Your view about right & wrong actions & what those do to a person's life
- It is heavy-handed but still valuable as it forces you to focus on a single moral idea

My Designing Principle:
- Book Smarts & Street Smarts are combined to form a new curriculum
My Theme Line:
- Only by opening himself up to all forms of intelligence will man become wiser

Splitting the Theme Into Oppositions:
Moral Decision:
- Man must choose righteousness over lawlessness

Characters as Variations on a Theme:
The Chars' Values in Conflict:
- Using your character web, now place the values of each of the major characters in conflict as these people compete for the same goal.
	1. Identify a set of values for your hero and each of the other major characters. Remember, values are deep- seated beliefs about what makes a good life.
	2. Try to give a cluster of values to each character. Make each set of values as different from the others as possible.
	3. As your hero and his opponents fight over the goal, make sure their values come into direct conflict

**Theme Through Structure**:
- At the beginning of the story, you set the hero and opponent in opposition. But the conflict is not intense, and the audience doesn't yet know how the values of each come into conflict. So they have almost no sense of the theme of the story.
- Throughout the middle of the story, the hero and the opponent come into increasing conflict, hence the converging structure. Through this conflict, a difference in values begins to emerge. So the theme starts to expand. Still, for most of a good story, the theme is largely hidden; it is quietly growing in the minds of the audience, and it will hit with full force at the end.
- The convergent point of story structure is the battle, and right after that, the self-revelation and moral decision. 
- In the battle, the audience sees not just which force but also which set of values is superior. The audience's understanding of the theme expands rapidly. At the self-revelation— especially if it's a moral self-revelation—the theme expands again. At the moral decision, it expands yet again. And because the theme has been expressed primarily through structure, it seems to emerge from the very soul of the audience, not to have been imposed on them like a tiresome sermon.

## Black Comedy:
- Black comedy is the comedy of the logic—or more exactly, the illogic—of a system
- This advanced and difficult form of storytelling is designed to show that destruction is the result not so much of individual choice (like tragedy) but of individuals caught in a system that is innately destructive
- The key feature of this moral argument is that you withhold the self-revelation from the hero to give it more strongly to the audience. This is how the black comedy moral argument works:
	- Many characters exist in an organization. Someone explains the rules and logic by which the system operates in great detail.
	- Many of these characters, including the hero, go after a negative goal that involves killing someone or destroying something.
	- Each believes strongly in the goal and thinks what he is doing makes complete sense. In fact, it is totally illogical.
	- The opponents, also within the system, compete for the same goal and also give detailed but insane justifications.  
	- One sane person, usually the ally, continually points out that none of this makes any sense and action will lead to disaster. He functions as a chorus, but no one listens to him.
	- All the characters, including the nominal hero, use extreme, sometimes even murderous, methods to reach the goal.
	- The actions of the characters lead to death and destruction for almost all.
	- The battle is intense and destructive, with everyone still thinking he is right. The consequences are death and madness.
	- No one, including the hero, has a self-revelation. But it is so obvious that the hero should have had a self- revelation that the audience has it instead.
	- The remaining characters are horribly maimed by the struggle but immediately resume their efforts to reach the goal.
	- Slightly more positive black comedies end with the sane person watching in horror and either leaving the system or trying to change it.

- This tricky form is easy to screw up. For the moral argument in black comedy to work, you must first make sure your hero is likeable. 
- Otherwise the comedy becomes an abstraction, an intellectual essay, as your audience backs away from the characters and feels morally superior to them. You want the audience to get sucked in so that they suddenly discover that they are these characters in some fundamental way and not above them.
- Besides a likable hero, the best way to pull the audience emotionally into a black comedy is to have your hero speak passionately about the logic of his goal.
- Writers who want to add some hope to the bleakness of the form give the lone sane person an alternative to the madness, worked out in detail.
- i.e. Goodfellas, Network, Dr. Strangelove,
