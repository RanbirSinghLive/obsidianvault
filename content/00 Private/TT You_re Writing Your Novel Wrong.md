- using microsoft word to start writing your novel is not the wave
- It'd be great if your brain worked like this, but it doesn't
- Write like you think - asynchronously 
- I use Obsidian
- Create a note, link it to other notes
- Don't impose a structure on your work until you're ready to hit publish
- Don't use more than a few folders, use backlinks & tags
- This leaves your notes ready to connect in surprising ways
- Let your novel grow organically
- Once you've got a solid organic structure & pages of notes, you can then start moving to a more traditional word processor if you like,
	- but at this point you'll probably be in love with Obsidian & not turning back
- I write a newsletter about writing my 1st novel in Obsidian. Link to bio
