# Should you buy retweets?

  

One time Mike from [our program](http://apply.tweetsandclients.com/) (with 2,000 followers at the time) goes "Hey guys, just closed $31k in deals this month. Thanks for the guidance."

And we all just stop.

We ask him "Dude‚Ä¶ what did you do?"

And what he said changed the way we all look at Twitter:

To explain, let's say you're trying to get a girlfriend. You've heard that most women are attracted to fit men so you decide to get fit.

And while that certainly doesn't hurt, somehow you don't get a girlfriend.

That's when you learn: maybe getting fit doesn't guarantee a girlfriend.

And just like getting in shape helps with women but doesn't guarantee one, retweets help with lead gen but doesn't guarantee it.

This is what Mike said:

"Yeah so I just started sending 50 DMs a day."

- That's it?

"Yeah that's it."

And we couldn't believe it until he showed us the conversations.

That's literally all he did.

When we have a big problem (not getting leads), we mistakenly assume we need a big solution (retweets). But if retweets guaranteed leads then big accounts would all have money. Which they don‚Äôt.

But you know what does guarantee leads? Starting conversations with prospects. Every. Single. Day.

Then we tried it with Peyton, another member of the program.

We gave him a landing page, copy, a VSL... The whole shtick.

Silence.

But then he started talking to 10 people every day:

Retweets are cool. No doubt about it.

DMs, however, are much faster, cheaper and if you're just starting out, way more profitable.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't build a following. A personal brand is a lubricant for business. Makes everything easier.

But if you don't want to wait for years to make money, our experience is that you don't need to.

You simply need to talk to more people.

# Selling On The DMs:

I've tested the direct DM approach of saying "Hey [first line], would you be interested in [dream outcome?]"

And it worked... ok. But I found that people got defensive and just didn't respond. If it works for you, keep doing it. If not, keep reading:

No matter your offer, you always need to do two things:

1. Build up trust

2. Qualify buyers

And that message does none of those two. So below is a better approach I stole from Taki Moore that does.

Disclaimer: if you use this word by word you will fail. Entrepreneurs need to think for themselves. So I'll provide the outline and you fill in the blanks.

# The 7-Step Sell-By-Chat Process

  

1. Opener

The goal here is to make it easy for them to reply. That's why we'll start with something non-threatening:

If someone engaged with your content, we say something like "Hey [name]! Appreciate the like üí™üèΩ"¬† or "Hey man I saw you [did x] + [intelligent question]"

2. This/That

The goal here is to both qualify and still be non-threatening.

My service is building Twitter audiences. So I can ask something like "Are you looking to get clients from Twitter or just building the personal brand?"

If you were a fitness coach you could ask something like "I saw you liked that thread on keto. Curious, are you doing keto or something else?"

Nice and easy.

3. Gap

Now we're qualifying.

I ask something like "So how many clients do you have right now and how many more can you take?"

Here's where you might go "JK that's a pretty hard question. What if they're not cooperative?"

Great question.

Remember: one of our goals is to qualify them. And if someone isn't willing to engage in a dialogue, that means they're not qualified.

And that's ok. Because you have millions of people you can DM anyway.

4. Need

One time on a call I gave Mr. Prospect the outline of my program. The whole uninterrupted 5-minute pitch. In the end he simply goes "Ok but do I get to talk 1-on-1 with you?"

- Yeah.

"That's all I wanted. Let's do it."

Sometimes we want to give people everything instead of the few things that they need. So the next question is very simple:

"Cool. What do you think you need the most right now?" / "Cool. What are the top 3 things you feel you need the most right now?"

5. Help

Sometimes we're so caught up in what we do that we forget what they need. And we don't ask the obvious question.

"Would you like some help?"

6. CTA

"Awesome. Are you free X time in Y day to talk for 15 minutes? Or I can send you my calendar if that's easier for you."

‚ÄúWould you be opposed to [seeing how we can get your dream outcome] with a team member this week?‚Äù

7. Urgency

I like to give them a reason to book a call right then and there.

"Cool. I'll keep my chat window open while you choose a time. Mind telling me you've found one that works?"

# Lubricating The Conversation

It‚Äôs important to make the conversation flow easily. Otherwise we risk not getting a response or even worse‚Ä¶ losing their trust.

  

On your messages try using the AAA Framework:

  

-   Acknowledge
    
-   Add Value
    
-   Ask
    

  

Example: ‚ÄúYeah man I feel that. I listened to a podcast the other day that mentioned‚Ä¶

  

So how many more clients can you take?‚Äù

  

Also pro tip: Talk like a kid Lots of messages. Excited. Playful. Light.

  

# Where do I find people to DM?

-   People who follow and/or engage with your Dream 100
    
-   People who follow and/or engage with you
    
-   People who engage with your Auto DMs
    
-   People who pop on your timeline
    
-   Past buyers
    
-   Past leads
    

# How do I follow up?

A lot of people will drop off when you start qualifying them. That‚Äôs completely normal. Nothing might happen for 3 follow-ups and then they sign with you on the 4th. You just never know.

Some ideas:

-   Best is to just continue the conversation in a natural way
    
-   React to your own message so it pops back up
    
-   ‚ÄúHey man just recorded a quick video on how we can help you with [what they asked for help with]‚Äù
    
-   Just checking in man, are you still interested in [what you asked for help with]?
    
-   Send a meme (we tested this and it actually works)
    

# Where do I keep track of these conversations?

I use Pipedrive. And it's not a fancy system at all (see below). The important thing is you actually talk and follow up with multiple people a day. Most don't.

# How do I stick to it?

It's easier to do things when we plan them in advance. So you could go to your calendar and block 30 minutes every day to start conversations and follow up with at least 10 people.

You'd be surprised at what happens‚Ä¶

# Things to have in mind:

-   Don't send essays. Send texts.
    
-   If they're rude to you, they're not a qualified buyer. And that's ok.
    
-   If they don't respond even after you've followed up many times, they're not a qualified buyer. And that's ok.
    
-   If they need a babysitter, they're not a qualified buyer. And that's ok.
    

And the most important one:

-   If you stick to it, it will work. If you don't stick to it, it will not work.
