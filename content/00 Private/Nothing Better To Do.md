## Lesson: Beware the man with nothing to lose

A friend was recounting a story from our early adulthood that I'd forgotten about.

He'd begun to hang out with an older man. One from his older brother's generation.

Pupu was the son of a trucking magnate, a popular venture for upwardly mobile Punjabi immigrant men.

Around our way, part of hanging out with an older guy involves becoming his unofficial chauffeur.

My friend, let's call him Waris, was driving the older dude (erm... Pupu) to get his girlfriend.

After she'd been collected, Pupu proceeded to pul out some coke and flaunt it around in the moving car.

It was around the holidays & the Toronto police were doing a RIDE check just ahead of them, looking for drunk drivers.

Pupu was on a coke high and turning up the soundsystem to uncomfortable levels.

Waris was trying to turn it back down to reduce their profile.

Pupu turned it back up.

Waris said 'yo chill the fuck out.'

He turned on his indicator to turn away from the RIDE check up ahead.

As he was doing that, Pupu said 'what that fuck did you just say to me kid?'

As he turned, Pupu punched him in the side of the head.

It goes without saying that it's unwise to start beating up your driver mid-turn.

So now Waris is driving the car with one hand, and keeping a drunk & high Pupu away with the other.

He looks in the rearview mirror for support from Pupu's girlfriend, who's just sitting there, mortified.

Waris is able to pull into the front lobby of a nearby building.

Pupu tells him to get out so they can fight.

They do.

Pupu swings at him, which Waris is able to block and push Pupu to the floor.

He decides not to hit him back due to how inebriated he is, and minimize the chances anyone around them will call the cops.

Pupu calls up from the ground, "If we beef, I'll win."

Waris says "what?"

"Listen kid, I don't work. My dad's trucks keep us fed. I don't have anything better to do. I'll just keep coming at you."

Waris sidesteps him to get in the car.

He looks back and asks Pupu's girl, are you staying in the car or getting out?

She stays. Waris turns on the car.

Out the window, a staggering Pupu says, "You'll slip up. I'll wait."

That could've been his actual words or the effect his previous words has on Waris.

They never hung out again.

The lesson is to fear the man with nothing to lose, and discontent in his heart.

While the rest of us go about our days, his mind is singular.

We all know people like this. For most of us, we're lucky enough that we only know them as Internet trolls.

Fear the man with nothing better to do.
