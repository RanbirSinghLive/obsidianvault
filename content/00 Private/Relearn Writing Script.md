## The New Writer's Path
- My 2nd chance at writing
	- Desire to opportunity
- Legacy Writing
- My reality (needed $)
	- I didn't realize it, but I was trading legacy writing for academic writer (the choice was binary back then)
- Academic Writing
- Corpo job
- Corporate Writing
	- Just an extension of academic writing
- Digital Writing
	- The viability of academic writing combined with the creativity of legacy writing
	- Discovered Clear Writing - which is just a dismissal of academic in favour of digital
	- Gained an audience

## The 8 Key Upgrades
- ### Quantity vs Quality
	- Length of sentences
	- Say it in 50 words instead of 5000
	- Edit by shortening
	- Use headings, lists, and tables to make reading easier
	- Proofread, edit, read on mobile (if intended to consume there)
	- Value Flow
		- Vary sentence length
		- Use active voice
		- Stick to the point
		- Avoid large paragraphs
		- 1 idea per paragraph
			- What is an idea? Stick to 1 sentence each mostly
		- Keep the subject & verb close together
- ### Slow vs Fast
	- Feedback loops
		- Engagement, comments
		- Iteration
	- For cred vs for reader
	- peer review vs engagement
- ### Nuanced vs Clear
	- Qualifiers
	- Reading Level
	- Stilted vs Flow
	- Write for your reader
	- No obscure words
	- Avoid industry jargon
	- Write for grade 3-7 level
		- Grade 3 as default: fake
		- Grade 7 for flair: counterfeit
		- Grade 12 hurts flow: spurious
- ### Rigid vs Flexible
	- Atomic Ideas / Lean Writing
	- Write atomic
		- 1 idea, explained well
		- Stack evergreen ideas into unique combinations
- ### Informed vs Beginner
	• 99% of your audience are beginners
	• Remove barriers to entry
	• Simplify complex topics
- ### Objective vs Subjective
	- It is thought that vs I think that
	- Research vs Credibillity
	- Unhedge your bets
		- Have an opinion. State it
		- Admit when you're wrong
	- Write from competence
		- Only write things that excite you
		- Know just a little more than your audience
- ### Critical vs Complimentary
	- (both are needed, but #2 works better in the real world)
	- Give more than you take
		- Don't just plug links to your content, ask to subscribe
- ### Formal vs Informal
	- Get with the times & speak the language of the people
- ### Isolated vs Networked
	- reading one way articles vs having conversations via writing
	 
## The Action Plan
- Goal: Earn from your Ideas
	- Work backwards
- This is all about joining a club
	- What would you do?
- Start Teaching
- Public Journaling
- Earning From Ideas
- How many people you can get in real life to read your work pales in comparison to online
	- I have 350 followers. I can'y fill a classroom in real life
- write 100 bad tweets, re-write the best ones 1000 different ways
- What people bullied you for in school is your competitive advantage online
- Put yourself out there
- Journal in public
- Write like you speak
- The way is short-form - better iteration, complimentary, give more than you take
- Reshow the matrix with simultaneous arrows pointing from left to right
- Convert the matrix into a checklist before/after each writing session
	- Every word counts
	- Set to publish ASAP
	- Is this clear?
	- Can I use the core idea again?
	- Can a beginner get value from this?
	- Do I have an opinion?
	- Am I being a bro?
	- Am I writing like I speak?
	- Is this sharable?

	- I gave up on the dream
