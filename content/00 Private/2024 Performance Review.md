2024 was another year of great successes and unique learning experiences. Overall, I far exceeded my mandate as Air Canada's primary expert on all regional market affairs. I drove several capacity deployments and fleet projects impactful to the company's bottom line. I extended beyond my operational domain to help deliver results in corporate, commercial and financial matters as well.

Select Accomplishments:
- Helped source approximately 8,100 block hours of annual incremental Jazz capacity through calculated reserve risk and other efficiencies. This is worth approximately $727K in incremental contribution excluding overhead to our network profitability
- Led the business case for lightweight seat replacement on the Jazz DH4 fleet. Will generate $2.1M in recurrent benefits across different branches over 2025-2035
- Assisted in the business case for the purchase of CR9 & DH4 SIMs by AC to replace CAE contract for Jazz pilot training. Will generate $11.5M in recurrent annual savings from 2026-2035
- Coordinated PAL's successful start of transborder operations after 10 months of preparations
- Led the deployment of the YCG Disruption Recovery Shuttle, improving winter schedule completion from ~50% to 97%
- Restated and amended the Jazz CPA - complex, long outstanding contractual item leftover from 2021
- Managed Project Fortitude commercial prioritization and ops continuation for Jazz and PAL
- Landline:
	- Successfully negotiated 1-year Transportation Services Agreement. The first multimodal CPA in Air Canada's history
	- Commenced sales in February and operations in May. Both on schedule in spite of tight timelines
	- To date, contract has yielded $4.46M in incremental revenue and a total operating loss of $1.08M, improving with each consecutive month
- Managed Air Canada's primary domestic codeshare and regional partners. YTD Revenues as follows:
	- PAL Interline: $6.81M
	- CMA Codeshare: $920K
	- PASCAN Interline: $328K

I believe the next frontier in my development is transforming my inherited mandate to better suit the company's future. I am developing the Regional and Evolving Transport framework to support this aim. My goal is to provide enough demonstrated and potential value to Air Canada to attain a Senior Director title by the end of 2025.
