- everyone wants you to succeed, just not more than them
- money solves money problems, not all problems
- you don't win, you just enter a new club as the smallest member
- passive income is overrated. the real goal is optionality between engaging activities
- if someone has become successful 'faster' than you, they are a better allocated of time
- **'Time allocation is the only thing that matters. If you master time, you master material success'**
- instead of being constantly busy, successful people make the right strategic decisions and focus on being wrong less
	- micro fast & macro slow vs micro slow & macro fast
- the most successful people stick to one thing for an outsized amount of time compared to their peers
- [[money is life energy]]
- big business is easer than small business as you can attract better talent to help you
- nobody wants to help with your lemonade stand, but everyone and their uncle will want to hear out your crypto idea

4 [[mental models]] for understanding [[Leverage]] and [[scale]]
1. Scale the Entrepreneur
2. Scale the Market
3. Scale the Deliverable
4. Scale the Business

**Scale the Entrepreneur**
- if you're not as successful as you want to be, it's because you're not as good as you think you are
- if you're stick its one of 3 deficiencies: skills, traits or beliefs
- skills are not a binary, but a continuum
- if you can't find good sales people, it's because you lack the skill of recruiting good sales people
- skills, traits and beliefs all compound

**Scale the Market**
- more successful people pick better markets
- select an avatar so that you can cater your product to them, then provide high value with low operational drag
- four attributes for a good market:
	- pain point
	- purchasing power
	- easy to target
	- growing market

**Scale the Deliverable**
- skills come from repetition and feedback
- do the boring work and [[outwork your self-doubt]]
1. go upmarket
2. go downmarket
3. go adjacent
4. go broader
5. go deeper

The Delivery Cube
Look at your delivery through six parameters:
1. can I deliver this product 1-on-1, small group and 1-to-many?
2.  can it be DIY, Done with you or done for you?
3. what kind of customer support do i want to provide
4. how do i want the product consumed (audio, video)
5. can i speed up or slow down the delivery time?
6. what would happen if I charged 10x current price, 1/10th current price or can i work based on only word of mouth from existing customers?

Tweak these parameters to be most profitable

The only six things you can sell (or a combination of them):
- products, services, access, media, risk, money
