- books are a unique way to learn due to being asynchronistic
- you can choose the speed with which to read each sentence, chapter etc.
- the point of reading is not to read a large volume
- the point is also not to absorb knowledge, as the internet provides us knowledge on demand
- the point of reading is to spark creativity
- a really good book has to be read slowly
- reading books is like lifting weights
- if you're reading books fast, you are lifting 'light' books that you are too familiar with. You need to increase the 'weight'
- if you're having trouble getting through each sentence of a book, it's too heavy for you right now
- you need to read at [[the edge of your ability]] so you can add your own thoughts to the book and learn something
- Naval reads the books that make him smarter (not biographies or tangential topics)
