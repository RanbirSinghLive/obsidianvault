# Intro


Echo chambers are the result of over-optimization in your personal systems, networks and cognitive processes.

We foster relationships, resonance and growth to live meaningful lives. 
We do this through social and psychological optimization patterns thay reinforce themselves over time  However, over-optimizing our lives can lead to dysfunction.

In a race to reach a simple solution to complex problems we may underfit a trend line (read: solution) to the available data points (read: total knowledge available). Over-fitting is just as bad and can be akin to not seeing the forest from the trees. Optimal fitting is the goal. Getting an actionable trend from the available data that is honest enough to the data points.

Echo chambers don't hit at our trending problems, but data problems. We aren't plotting all the data points we can on the graph to make our conclusions.

The problem of echo chamber is the problem of how we omit and emphasize data points.

We are being too picky.

If a picky diner returns, you offer them the 'regular.' 

Too much exploiting and not enough exploring is causing echo chambers.

Echo chambers are the result of a particular solution to the multi-armed bandit problem. 

That problem has at it's core a trade-off between exploring and exploiting.

Should you exploit the 'best' of what you already have, or look for something 'better'. How we are grating things is in terms of your understanding of the true nature of the world.

The core assumption here is you want to learn, know and teach the true nature of things. The 'truth' isn't necessarily a simple answer to a complex problem, but at least an accurate assesment of the factual reality of a thing.

In the explore/exploit tradeoff, the interval matters, as well as the constraints. The biggest constraint is time remaining, or age in our case.

The interval is the strategy.

An echo chamber gives the illusion of exploring. But you are just retrieving the same data.

An echo chamber is a complex machine.

**What are the downsides?**
Is diversity strength?
Not battle tested.
The chamber implies exclusion and division (protection?)
Unequipped to handle things outside of the chamber
What are the boundaries of the chamber and do you exist outside of it?
If yes, then problems are inherent.
If no, will this always be the case? Uncertain and risky assumption
If still no, is there even an outside? If yes, you know nothing of the enemy
If still no, it is not a chamber

A king's court can be an echo chamber - find hist examples. Contemporary to torture chambers so may be a good linkage.

Find a king who tortured you if you disagreed with him.
