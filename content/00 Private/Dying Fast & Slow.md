I lost two fathers in two years in very different ways.

My biological dad had a stroke while watching the Tokyo Olympics. His last words were “I can’t feel my arm," before he was rushed to the hospital. 

He died 2 days later. 

There was no warning of his demise. He had the strength of a horse up until the day prior.

My dad-in-law declined over many years. He had a long succession of 'lasts.' 

- Last time driving himself
- Last time cooking for himself
- Last time dressing himself

One dad died fast. The other died slowly.

Is one way better? How can this inform how you live your life?

Dying fast means having no awareness of the end approaching. No plans on what to do afterwards. No chance for anyone to say goodbye.

Dying slowly means being acquainted with the approach of the end. Estate planning & jealousy over your estate. Saying bye to people on every visit like it may be the last one.

Of course, both my dads refused to plan their ends, which made things even harder.

But comparing the 2 possible endings loses its value when you realize the critical missing ingredient.

Choice.

Choice in death is impossible, despite any effort to live healthier or safer.

The choices lie in living.

The main choice is the community you build. 

The person next to my dad in hospice care was dying alone. My dad had so many visitors we had to sneak past the Covid visitation guards. 

The community you build should also cross age groups. The most common way to do this is to have kids, but having younger friends also helps.

The community you build also becomes the reason you plan your end. You want it to be as easy on them as possible. 

We talk about impact, but the most palpable impact is how you leave your community feeling after your death:

- Unsure of your wishes
- Resentful
- Regretful

That's the impact I'm optimizing against.
