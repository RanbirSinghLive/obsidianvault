[[John Truby]][[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft

What's promised by the idea to the audience:
- The promise of raising the stakes on crime as the story goes on
- 'crime doesn't pay'
- Higher stakes as the story goes on
- Friends splitting up
- Someone choosing a higher purpose
- Happy getting humbled
- Saad getting arrested

What if...? 
- There is Punjabi, Somali & Jamaican slang throughout?
- This becomes a love letter to 2000s Toronto
- This explains previously unhighlighted aspects of 2nd gen immigrant life
- This pushes the boundaries on what is acceptable in coming of age narratives these days
- Saad's gang gets larger than life
- There are weave-ins with Rob Ford's saga
- Happy goes to India in the story
- Happy gets a job at the polling institute that shows him demographics of his neighbourhood that touch him in an unexpected way
