Most of what i do involves being a human switch board.

All the [[00 Private/META]] these days centres around things like deep work, ignoring your emails and saying no to things.

If i followed that advice i would be fired at each step of my journey.

I'm an operator at a company requiring oversight of a 24/7 operation.

I need to Triage each email as it comes in. Sometimes I can impact a decision only if i respond within minutes.

Instead of shunning email and distraction, net workers need to lean in and do some [[surfing]].

Typical Net Work:
Monitoring emails and project pages
Making high level decisions
Removing roadblocks
Arbitrating disputes
