Ideas won't take off without a test flight.

Put your ideas through a 'wind tunnel' to see if they can fly.

Your 'wind tunnel' could be:
- Twitter
- Private Community
- Intellectual Sparring Partner
- Your mum

The response will allow you to pinpoint 'drag' and make your idea more sleek to compensate.

From there it's time for the active runway.
