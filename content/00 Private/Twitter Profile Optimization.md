# Profile Optimization Checklist

Run through this checklist. Feel free to create your own ClickUp account or copy/paste it into another app if you want to check things off.

  

## High level

Your profile showcases...

-   A specific benefit someone gets from following you
-   Your unique method
-   Your credibility (proof that following you is valuable)
-   A personal touch (optional)

  

### Clarity

-   Name and @-handle make sense together
-   Uses sentence case (Not Title Case)
-   Lists have no more than 3 ideas (e.g. "Sharing lessons on profile pics, banners, and pinned tweets."
-   Remove wasted words (~~I tweet about, I also talk about)~~

  

### Credibility

-   Has 1-3 credibility signals (years of practice, well-known companies, money made, number of clients, etc)
-   Following followers ratio is flattering (Once you're above 50 followers, never follow more than follow you. Work toward a 1:3 ratio.)

  

### Hide useless info

-   Hide job type
-   Hide birthday
-   Hide location (or use it as a clever text field to draw attention to your link)

  

### Not self-serving or salesy

-   No hashtags
-   Be very cautious about self promotion. Including an offer makes it look like you're more likely to promote yourself in your feed and reduces follows

  

## Visuals

### Profile

-   Vibe check. Do you look warm, friendly, and trustworthy?
-   Image is sharp (not low res)
-   Face is centered and not tilted unless intentionally off center
-   Don't use a plugin to put a partially colored circle around your profile pic that nobody understands but you

### Banner

-   Vibe check. Is this the right vibe for your niche? Professional enough? Polished enough?
-   Should have few words. (Like 7-10 max)
-   Words/visuals aren't covered up on mobile by time/banner/etc
-   Colors match or are harmonious with profile pic
-   Don't use a plugin to highlight your recent followers. Again, these plugins don't actually improve your follow rate

  

## Pinned Tweet

-   Highlights the main idea behind your account (not a random Tweet)
-   Has good engagement stats compared to your average tweet
-   Value is here on Twitter (not a link you have to click)

  

## 3 Final profile tests

-   **Mobile test.** Check it on your mobile phone again. Is anything messed up?
-   **5 second test**. Just look at your profile for a very short time. DOn't read the whole thing. Did you get enough information to want to follow or want to read more?
-   **Squint test.** Squint your eyes. Do the graphics still pop? If not, consider adjusting color/contrast.

# Case Study: @JohnIsBuilding

  

For months, small profile mistakes were holding John's follower count in the low hundreds.

  

Here's the step-by-step advice I gave him (with screenshots), to get him above 1,300 followers (+800) in 3 weeks back in June/July 2022.

  

As I write this 3 months later, off of that momentum, he's ~10X'd to 12.3K.

  

This is how we set that growth machine into motion:

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/2804e630-d10f-4a96-8837-43da0684813e/image.png)

  

Above is John's original profile when [@JohnIsBuilding](https://twitter.com/JohnIsBuilding) asked for my help.

  

Right away I see major credibility killers and a bunch of missed opportunities.

  

Profiles should:

-> Tell the visitor what THEY get

-> Show your POV

-> Prove credibility

  

Here are the 8 tweaks I gave him:

  

### 1) Visual Polish

  

He has a clear, simple, value-driven message on his banner.

  

But John's background is a totally different color palette than his pic. It looks cheap and amateurish.

  

FIX: Match the colors

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/6c70259a-14a4-43b9-a997-9792d335de60/image.png)

  

### 2) Wasted Words

  

Your profile is about THEM, not you.

  

Plus, everyone's tweeting. Duh.

  

FIX: Remove "I talk about" and replace with value-driven copy.

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/aaf877fd-0bff-46bc-9941-093e4ce658d6/image.png)

  

### 3) Credibility Killers

  

Don't give potential followers a disclaimer that your tweets might not be great.

  

Focus on what they'll get, and live up to it.

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/71c19605-c4a0-4a68-aa08-69a729320824/image.png)

  

### 4) Quantify Value

  

John built this hugely profitable company from nothing. He knows a ton.

  

But you couldn't tell from his original profile.

  

Attach a number to what you've done:

-   years of experience
-   $
-   total sales

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/32ca0362-9035-4341-b702-5abbb9bb4395/image.png)

  

### 5) Professional Category Adds Nothing

  

Don't put data in your profile just because you can.

  

Unless you're marketing in a specific industry, remove the category.

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/9a92a7a3-96b3-4a74-a11c-1a800e8c8bbd/image.png)

  

### 6) Bad follow/follower ratio

  

Too many followers makes you look unpopular.

  

Never to follow-for-follow.

  

John's number isn't terrible, but he doesn't look _in demand_.

  

Get that following number down.

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/e0617562-a271-49f0-8f7c-7b1b22bc97ad/image.png)

  

### 7) Oops. Forgot About Mobile

  

Most people use Twitter from their phones.

  

Most people update their profile from a computer.

  

John's main CTA, "Start" is partially covered.

  

Always double-check on the phone.

  

![](https://t42042215.p.clickup-attachments.com/t42042215/240228a3-dd54-4990-a80e-835e02eacbe9/image.png)

  

  

### 8) No Line Breaks On Mobile, Either

  

A lot of people don't know that line breaks don't appear on mobile.

  

The text just runs together.

  

Use punctuation to counter this.

### Results

  

I asked John if he'd write up something on what happened.

  

Here's what he sent me:

  

> I reached out to Rob initially because it took me 44 days to go from 30-297 followers.  
>   
> I was posting a thread a day, getting no feedback, & doing everything by myself...this week I'll break 1,000 followers.  
>   
> Other things worth mentioning...  
>   
> **Before Rob's group:**  
>   
> My traction came from borrowing the credibility of others & curation.  
>   
> My follows were from anon accounts with cartoon PFPs that were trying to sell me NFTs.  
>   
> I was writing by myself & got no feedback.  
>   
> **After Rob's group:**  
>   
> Some of my unique ideas have gone viral. I've had two VCs reach out & ask to chat about my company.  
>   
> Others have asked for paid business consulting.  
>   
> I have a community of people who're better than me, that take time out of their day to improve my content."
