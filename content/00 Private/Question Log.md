- Greg Cronie: Hi Ranbir, saw your post on forming a digital partnership. Are you willing to share some details about it?

- Chris Garcia: Hey Ranbir hope everything is going well from the looks of it your twitter is growing that is awesome. I dont know if I missed it but I was looking forword to learning more about Obsidian did I miss your teachings?
