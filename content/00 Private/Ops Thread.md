Content needs operations to win.

I've spent 12 years operating an airline.

Here are my transferrable lessons to apply to content creation.


- look at things as complex problems 
- use 2nd order thinking
- new problem becomes old solution


- get the highest leverage thing done first
- get the thing done that lets others work - eliminate waiting
- know who to call for x
- buffer means better decisions
- tell people about your challenges so they can help


That's a wrap!
