**Russell's teapot** is an [analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy "Analogy"), formulated by the philosopher [Bertrand Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [philosophic burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof "Philosophic burden of proof") lies upon a person making empirically [unfalsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability")claims, rather than shifting the burden of _disproof_ to others.

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot#cite_note-1) He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong.

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [existence of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God "Existence of God"), and has had influence in various fields and media.
