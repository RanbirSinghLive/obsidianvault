1/ After months spent trying to build a second brain, I recently switched to @Obsidian

I've written more in the last week than in the last three months.

Here's how Obsidian can accelerate you towards the end goal of Writing. More. Insights.

2/ Don't try to build the perfect productivity tool from scratch

I spent two weeks designing my own @Notion Life OS in the vein of @August Brady's PPV system.

That's two weeks spent linking databases instead of writing. Don't fall into this trap.

3/ Don't overengineer your productivity system.

My day job is self-contained the @Microsoft ecosystem.

My personal tasks fit quite well in @Todoist.

I goal-set in a bullet journal to review 3x a year.

That's it. Now I can spend all my free time doing what matters - Writing.

4/ Focus on your goal instead of creating fancy tools

I want to write insightful ideas and share them with the world

My 2nd brain should help instead of hinder

@Obsidian is simple to start

You write notes and link them. That's it

Plugins are there for when you need them

5/ My @Obsidian Workflow (inspired by @Zettlekasten)

1. Write rough notes
2. Edit notes to be atomic and personal
3. Link notes to other relevant notes
4. Review your notes & their connections to get inspired
5. Write content around interesting connections

6/ Let your productivity system grow 'just in time'.

Your system shouldn't be static, but don't change it until you come up against issues

Spend 95% of your time on the work. Spend 5% on the workflow.
