Mike Sowden writes on [[Substack]] about the science of curiosity and 'wow' moments.

Mike is not an expert at any of the topics he covers. His skills are enthusiasm, a little experience and [[storytelling]].

It's important to own up when you get something wrong, and when to say 'I don't know.' This earns respect from readers.

A look at Mikeâ€™s subscriber dashboard.

## Decision to Monetize:
Mike knew he wanted to monetize eventually from the beginning. He used to be a travel writer before experiencing [[burnout]] from his mother's declining health. 

### Impact from writing a [[90 Templates/Newsletter]]:
1. Write about curiosity and how it makes you more hopeful and interested in the world
2. Given him enthusiasm, optimism
3. He now has the ability to focus
4. This has recently become his main source of income

[[Consistency]] is a consideration, but Mike will delay a post in the spirit of doing a good job. The delayed world will usually get a better social response due to the higher quality.

Mike creates his work in [[content seasons]] which allows him to foreshadow, summarize, and take breaks after sprints.

### [[Pricing]]:
Mike charges $6 instead of the usual $5 because the difference is imperceptible to his audience but it compounds to make a difference for him. 

Don't be too formulaic. Make your own spin on the usual way your genre is delivered. It doesn't make your work look inferior, it makes it look genuine.

Mike makes reference to [[Paul Graham]]'s work who advices to do things that don't scale. Mike writes personalized emails to new paid subscribers. That is something bigger newsletters can't do.
