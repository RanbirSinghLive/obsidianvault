This isn’t my first newsletter. I’ve tried this before but failed. That’s because I tied it to a tiny niche instead of tying it to me, the niche of one.

Still, as I’ve gained traction on Twitter I’ve missed writing more personally and detailed. So you are my inner circle. And I’m asking for your time each week.

Starting an email newsletter means asking for people's time.

I need to deliver a great email to justify that.

I've grown my email list primarily off Twitter. but I'd lose the plot if I applied Twitter writing principles to email.

## How Newsletter Writing Differs From Twitter:

- Nuance is allowed
- You don't get into the gritty details
- You can take longer to paint a picture


- Both rely on call to action & being kind to the reader 

I've had bosses several levels up from me who dont have time. I need to spoonfeed them and they value it.

That leeway comes with trust, which I hope I've build a little with you.

Don't take your twitter learning & swing your dick into work emails.

Clear writing for Twitter rules generally apply, but the game is different.

Differences:


- Subject lines are copy
- bullet points and bold the CTA
- shorter is better
- avoid the "throat-clearing"
	- just circling back
	- i hope you're doing well
	- to be cordial, i use "Hope you're well."
- Direct is great, and leave an out at the end.
- Smiley emojis can hedge against your direct tone (YMMV)
-
