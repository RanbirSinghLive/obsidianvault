[[Naval Ravikant]] provides three possible answers

1. Your answer is personal to you. A prescribed answer will sound meaningless to you.
	1. It might take you decades but when you find it, it will be essential to you
2. There is no meaning of life. No one will live long enough in the context of the universe to have any bit of significance.
	1. Since there is no meaning, you are free to make your own
	2. What [[God]] would just you based on a 80 year life when God is infinite?
	3. [[Osho]]: life is the purpose. 
3. This is a physics based answer. We're headed towards the [[heat death of the universe]]. 
	1. Any [[complex system]] we create or action we take is creating [[entropy]]
	2. More entropy accelerates us towards the heat death sooner
	3. This is an unsatisfying answer.
