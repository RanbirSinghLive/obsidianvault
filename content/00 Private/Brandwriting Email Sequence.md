# Day 1

- Welcome to your journey to becoming a brandwriter
- Here is the link to the Content Mirror
- Your content should be a reflection...
- Clear Writing is Clear Thinking
- All of my writing builds & reinforces my personal brand, which is the biggest business catalyst there is
- I turned from writing for so long, and then it unlocked the key of business for me. Tomorrow I'll show you how (tease for tomorrow)

# Day 2
- I started writing as a scholarship in high school
- I left writing for many years to make money
- But the money was in writing all along
- I discovered the internet, business & Obsidian & AI
	- Chess, Tiktok, Forex
- I started writing & met Bernardo
	- He needed content so I coached him
	- We realized what was needed and we started offering it
	- The results blew us away... tease for tomorrow

# Day 3
- Meet Wayne
- He offered landing pages
- He also had experience creating Youtube, writing everything in the past
- He just needed accountability & a way to put everything together
	- Shiny object syndrome
	- Just doing the next step
	- Doin more of what works
	- Sharing your true self
- And the results speak for themselves
- From 200 to 1,500 in 1 month
	- Now he's got booked calls, closing clients and it's JUST THE BEGINNING


# Day 4
- This is usually when people offer free calls
- But brandwriting centers on efficiency
- I believe too many calls contribute to the death of small businesses
- And I'm trying to help you succeed, not fail
- Instead, here is what I offer
	- The price, well my partner would kill me if I quoted you something out of thin air
	- Just know that our packages start at $1,000 & scale their ticket and impact from there 
	- But for now, know that you'll get earn back every dime you spend with us
	- I'll let my partner sell you on the rest
	- I'll do what I do best, write you another value packed email

# Day 5
- This is my second brain (photo)
- I have the entire Brandwriting framework in there. Now I'll just need to turn it into actionable stuff, and what better way to do that then send it to you
- Please implement everything, and if..
	- Write to grow
	- Write to sell
	- Make a sale
	- We can get on a phonecall
- Until then, we'll be regular penpals
