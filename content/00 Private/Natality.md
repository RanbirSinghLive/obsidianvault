This was, in a way, the problem with [Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden). [The Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man) may have been a curse for any number of reasons but it was a blessing in so far it made Eve and Adam engaged cultivators of the world. It saved them from mindless and feckless bliss. It endowed them with a depth and a density. It enabled them to _earn heart_. With the possibility of mortality, came the prospect of “natality” – the initiation of new beginnings through human action [a concept used by the influential German-Jewish political thinker [Hannah Arendt](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/) (1906-1975)]. Mentioning a painting of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden by the Italian Renaissance artist Masaccio, Harrison writes:

> It is invariably Eve who is moving toward the exit first, as if in eager anticipation of her new future, while Adam, looking forlorn, seems in dread of what’s to come. Adam, no doubt, did not hear the call of natality as intensely as Eve. Indeed, it is doubtful that he ever would have taken the initiative when it came to the forbidden fruit. Eve’s transgression was the first true instance of human action, properly understood. It was in itself already an act of motherhood, for through it she gave birth to the mortal human self, which realizes its potential in the unfolding of time, be it through work, procreation, art, or the contemplation of things divine. God should have foreseen that by endowing Eve with a potential for natality, he made it painful for her to endure the sterile mirror which the garden reflected back on her.
