Make decisions easy for busy people. You will rise fast in your career if busy people like working with you. Hereâ€™s a tip: when you have a problem to solve, come prepared with a suggested next step. If you have a question, phrase it in a way they can answer yes/no. If there are multiple options, lay them out and ask them to pick one. Try to avoid expansive, open-ended questions.
