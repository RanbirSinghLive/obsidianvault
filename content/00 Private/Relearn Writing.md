# Promise:

Upgrade from an academic to a digital writing style in 30 minutes.

note: 
- We're in the midst of a shift to a new economy
- It's been called the digital, creator, attention economy
- School taught you the wrong way to write for that economy
- It's time to rewire your brain.

This is the story of a 2nd chance at writing.

note: 
- That 2nd chance was mine & it'll be yours too
- This is me in high school
- It's Junior year & I really needed a scholarship to go to university
- Most scholarships require impeccable grades so I didn't stand a chance
- But one scholarship only required writing a short story for a full year's tuition
- I saw this as low-risk & high reward
- I entered and I won
