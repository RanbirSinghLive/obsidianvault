# Finding Your [[Niche]]

Ali - What would I have wanted to know three years ago and can I ask as a big brother to the person?

What content do I like watching and YouTuber do I want to be? Based on that what audience do I want to attract and what videos would they like to see?

Sean - start with what you like, but also think ‘what is the market size?’ This is if you also want to turn your hobby into a business. In that case, don’t do this on hard mode. **Does this audience have money?**

Starting with a monied audience allows you to sustain, and then help people who don’t have money.

Sean found more joy in getting people unstuck vs creating his own art. So he re-focused to helping people start online businesses

You need to pick an audience who’s problems you don’t mind living in all day long. You want to read minds and make them think ‘how did he know I was thinking that?’

The problems you know the solutions to, you have to stay there as those people will continue having those problems. If you want to help new moms, can you think about new moms’ problems all day long, or will you get sick of them?

# [[Dunning Kruger Effect]]

The more you know, the more you don’t know. Ali’s fear.

Sean thinks the person who is the best to teach someone something is the person who was just there themselves vs the expert who was there 10 years ago.
