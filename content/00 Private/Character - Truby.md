[[John Truby]] [[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft 

- begin looking at all characters as part of a web
- distinguished against each other according to story function
- next, individualize each character based on them & opposition
- drill down on hero, build him step-by-step
- drill down on opponent
- work on techniques to build conflict
- 4 major character oppositions
	- story function
	- archetype
	- theme
	- opposition
- 4 major kinds of characters:
- Hero:
	- owns central problem
	- drives the action to attempt to solve the problem
	- decides on a goal (desire) but has weaknesses & needs that hold him back from success
- Opponent:
	- Wants the same thing as the hero & wants to stop the hero from getting it
	- Can be hero's lover or friend, not necessarily someone he hates
- Ally:
	- serves as a sounding board, allowing reader to hear values & feelings of hero
	- can have same goal as hero, or goal of his own
- Fake-Ally Opponent:
	- appears to be friend but is actually opponent
	- adds a twist & increases the stakes
	- one of most most complex chars as he is usually torn by a dliemma
- Fake-Opponent Ally:
	- flip of fake-ally opponent
	- much rarer
- Subplot Character:
	- subplot used to contrast how hero & subplot char tackle the same problem in slightly different ways
	- tracks a line parallel to the hero with diff results
- Extraneous Characters:
	- Cut them if they don't serve an important function in the overall story

- Char Web by Archetype
	- archetypes are fundamental psych patterns within a person
	- give them detail, otherwise they become stereotypes
- King or Father
	- Strength: Leads his family or his people with wisdom, foresight, and resolve so that they can succeed and grow
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can force his wife, children, or people to act according to a strict and oppressive set of rules, can remove himself entirely from the emotional realm of his family and kingdom, or may insist that his family and people live solely for his pleasure and benefit
- Queen or Mother:
	- Strength: Provides the care and protective shell within which the child or the people can grow.
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can be protective or controlling to the point of tyranny, or can use guilt and shame to hold the child close and guarantee her own comfort.
- Wise Old Man, Wise Old Woman, Mentor, or Teacher:
	- Strength: Passes on knowledge and wisdom so that people can live better lives and society can improve
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can force students to think a certain way or speak for the glory of himself rather than the glory of his ideas
- Warrior:
	- Strength The practical enforcer of what is right
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can live according to the harsh motto of "kill or be killed"; may believe that whatever is weak must be destroyed and so become the enforcer of what is wrong
- Magician or Shaman:
	- Strength: Can make visible the deeper reality behind the senses and can balance and control the larger or hidden forces of the natural world.
	- Inherent Weakness: Can manipulate the deeper reality to enslave others and destroy the natural order
- Trickster:
	- The trickster is a lower form of the magician archetype and is extremely popular in modern storytelling.
	- Strength: Uses confidence, trickery, and a way with words to get what he wants.
	- Inherent Weakness: May become a complete liar who looks out only for himself
- Artist or Clown
	- Strengths: Defines excellence for a people or, negatively, shows them what doesn't work; shows them beauty and a vision of the future or what appears to be beautiful but is in fact ugly or foolish.
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can be the ultimate fascist insisting on perfection, may create a special world where all can be controlled, or simply tears everything down so that nothing has value.
- Lover
	- Strength: Provides the care, understanding, and sensuality that can make someone a complete and happy person.
	- Inherent Weaknesses: Can lose himself in the other or force the other to stand in his shadow
- Rebel
	- Strength: Has the courage to stand out from the crowd and act against a system that is enslaving people.
	- Inherent Weakness Often cannot or does not provide a better alternative, so ends up only destroying the system or the society.

- Individualizing Chars in the Web:
	- Theme: your view of the proper way to act in the world, expressed through your characters as they take action through the plot
	- Not subject matter like "racism"
	- Theme is moral vision - how to live well or badly

- Moral Problem: Should one be lawless & part of a community or righteous & stand alone?
- Each Character:
	- Weakness:
	- Psych Need:
	- Moral Need:
	- Desire:
	- Values:
	- Power, Status & Ability
- Compare Hero to Opponent
- Compare everyone to everyone

Creating Your Hero:
- Make him fascinating
- Make audience identify, but not too much
- Make audience empathize, not sympathize with hero
	- understand him but not necessarily like everything he does
	- If you show the audience why the character chooses to do what he does, they understand the cause of the action (empathy) without necessarily approving of the action itself (sympathy)
- Give your hero a moral & a psych need
Char Change: The self expressed as a char
- Char change is made possible at the beginning of the story by the setup
- the bigger the range of change, the more interesting but riskier the story
- true char change is in beliefs, not behaviours or station in life
Commons Types of Char Change:
- Child to Adult
	- A true coming-of-age story shows a young person challenging and changing basic beliefs and then taking new moral action
- Adult to Leader
	- a character goes from being concerned only with finding the right path for himself to realizing that he must help others find the right path as well
- Cynic to Participant
	- the character begins as someone who sees value only in himself. He has pulled away from the larger society and is interested in pleasure, personal freedom, and money. By the end of the story, the hero has learned the value of making the larger world right and has rejoined society as a leader
- Leader to Tyrant
- Leader to Visionary
- Metamorphosis
- Double Reversal:
	- Both hero & opponent have self-revelations - most common in love stories
	- Fleabag "This is a love story"
Desire
- there can only be 1 desire line - ratcheting in intensity
- it needs to be specific
- "becomes independent" is more of a need & makes for a poor desire
- the audience should be clear on when the hero achieves or fails at the desire. independence is vague
- the desire should pass/fail near the end of the story
The Opponent:
- the hero is only as good as the person he fights
- Make the oppo necessary
- Make him human
- Give him values that oppose the values of the hero
- Give the oppo a strong but flawed moral argument
- Give him certain similarities to the hero
- Keep him in a the same place as the hero

Building Conflict:
- build a web of oppositions, not just between 2 people
- 4 Corner Opposition
	- add 2 2ndary oppos
	- each oppo should use a different way of attacking the hero's great weakness
		- reps a complete society in miniature
	- Try to put everyone in conflict with each other
		- results in intense conflict & dense plot
	- Put the values of all 4 in conflict
		- not just a single value for each, but a cluster
		- think negative & positive of each value (in same person)
		- Examples of positive and negative versions of the same value are determined and aggressive, honest and insensitive, and patriotic and domineering
	- Push the chars to the corners
		- Make them as different as possible
	- Extend the 4 corner pattern to every level of the story
		- within the society, institution, family, even a single char

## Exercise:
- Character Web by Story Function and Archetype
	- Create your character web
	- Start by listing all of your characters, and describe what function they play in the story (for example, hero, main opponent, ally, fake-ally opponent, subplot character)
	- Write down next to each character the archetype, if any, that applies
- Central Moral Problem
	- List the central moral problem of the story
- Comparing the Characters:
	- List and compare the following structure elements for all your characters
		1. Weaknesses  
		2. Need, both psychological and moral 
		3. Desire
		4. Values  
		5. Power, status, and ability  
		6. How each faces the central moral problem  
		- Begin the comparison between your hero and main opponent.  
- Variation on the Moral Problem 
	- Make sure each character takes a different approach to the hero's central moral problem
- Requirements of a Hero 
	- Now concentrate on fleshing out your hero
	- Begin by making sure you have incorporated the four requirements of any great hero:
		1. Make your lead character constantly fascinating.
		2. Make the audience identify with the character, but not too much.
		3. Make the audience empathize with your hero, not sympathize.
		4. Give your hero a moral as well as a psychological need.
- Hero's Character Change 
	- Determine your hero's character change
	- Write down the self-revelation first, and then go back to the need
	- Make sure the self-revelation actually solves the need
	- In other words, whatever lies or crutches the hero is living within the beginning must be faced at the self-revelation and overcome
- Changed Beliefs 
	- Write down the beliefs your hero challenges and changes over the course of your story
- Hero's Desire 
	- Clarify your hero's desire line
	- Is it a single, specific goal that extends throughout the story? 
	- When does the audience know whether the hero has accomplished the goal or not?
	- Opponents 
		- Detail your opponents
		- First describe how your main opponent and each of your lesser opponents attack the great weakness of your hero in a different way.
	- Opponents' Values 
		- List a few values for each opponent.
		- How is each opponent a kind of double for the hero?
		- Give each some level of power, status, and ability, and describe what similarities each shares with the hero.
	- State in one line the moral problem of each character and how each character justifies the actions he takes to reach his goal.
- Minor Character Variation on the Hero's Weakness and Moral Problem 
	- In what ways are any of the minor characters variations on the hero's unique weakness and moral problem?
- Four-Corner Opposition 
	- Map out the four-corner opposition for your story
	- Put your hero and main opponent on the top line with at least two secondary opponents underneath
	- Label each character with his or her archetype, but only if it is appropriate.
	- Many characters are not archetypes. Don't force it.
- Push the four major characters to the corners
	- That is, make sure each is as different from the other three as possible
	- The best way to ensure that is to focus on how the values of each differ.
