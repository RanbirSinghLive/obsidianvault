Brandwriting is my attempt at languaging.

In marketing speech, that sounds like a big idea. And I've come up with a name for it.

That sounds like a big idea, and I've come up with a name to make that big idea a reality.

In marketing a big idea is new, big/fast, exciting, tackles main pain

That requires you to be valuable. The easiest way to be valuable is to hold proprietary knowledge

First you need to learn how to be yourself in a way that gets noticed. 

Then you need to find a way to get paid for that activity.

Going to personal branding and writing leads you to find intersections of ideas. Brandwriting is itself a intersection

New ideas are rare, if you think of them in a rigid sense. Most new things are just a combination of old things.

I have the same skills today as I did yesterday, but they're worth 10x more now. And all I had to do was invent 1 word.

Brandwriting.

But let me rewind.

My digital journey looks aimless from afar. I've tried:

- Forex
- Tiktok Chess streaming
- Number Twitter niches

But it's not aimless. It's skill acquisition.

And in 2023, the good ideas sit at the intersection of skills.

Mine intersects personal branding & writing

The thread:
Brandwriting is a framework that leads to success. Here is how it works. Start using it.

- Naming the intersection increases value
	- Online you can name them permissionlessly
	- IRL you need to do something notable to get an intersection named after you
	- My last street was named after a guy who got kidnapped by terrorist and stuffed in the trunk of a car, so might not be the best route
- Positioning
- Name leads to mission
	- Get paid to be yourself
- Mission needs tactile feel
- 2 goals & 1 toolkit
- Growth
	- social media, personal, intellectual
- Sales
	- capitalism is our META, for better or worse
	- Sales is a value exchange ( a *perceived* value exchange)
- Tools of the Future
	- PKM, AI, social media, atomic thinking
	- spaced repetition (forgetting curve) in content
		- We need to be reminded more than we're taught
- You'll become a Brandwriter too, but you'll invent a word for it
