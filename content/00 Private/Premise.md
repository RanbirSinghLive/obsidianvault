[[John Truby]] [[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft

- Story in one sentence
- Simplest combination of character & plot
- Typically consists of trigger event, some sense of the protagonist & some sense of the outcome
- The Godfather: The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father & becomes the new Godfather
- The premise will become your prison - think carefully - **take weeks**

# **Developing Your Premise**
1. **Write something that may change your life**
2. **Look for what's possible** 
	1. Brainstorm the many different paths the idea can take
	2. The Godfather: A story about a Mafia family promises ruthless killers and violent crime. But what if you make the head of the family much bigger, make him a kind of king in America? What if he is the head of the dark side of America, just as powerful in the underworld as the president is in official America? Because this man is a king, you could create grand tragedy, a Shakespearean fall and rise where one king dies and another takes his place. What if you turn a simple crime story into a dark American epic?
3. **Identify the Story Challenges & Problems**
	1. Star Wars: In any epic, but especially a space epic like Star Wars, you must introduce a wide range of characters quickly and then keep them interacting over vast space and time. You must make the futuristic story believable and recognizable in the present. And you must find a way to create character change in a hero who is morally good from the beginning.
4. **Find the [[Designing Principle]]**
	1. Overall strategy on how to tell the story, in one line
	2. Helps extend the premise into deep structure
	3. Internal logic of the story
	4. What makes the story original
	5. Designing Principle = story progress + original execution
	6. The Godfather: Use the classic fairy-tale strategy of showing how the youngest of three sons becomes the new "king."
	7. Examples of Designing Principles
		1. A journey
		2. A single symbol (the whale in Moby Dick)
		3. 2 grand symbols connected
		4. units of time (day, night, 4 seasons)
		5. unique use of a storyteller
		6. a special way the story unfolds
5. **Determine your best character in the idea**
	1. Always tell the story of the best character
	2. Who do I love? Do I care about his challenges?
	3. If multiple main characters, you must love them all
6. **Get a sense of the central conflict**
	1. Who fights whom over what?
7. **Get a sense of the single cause-and-effect pathway**
	1. A lead to B which leads to C ... Z
	2. The spine of the story
	3. Bad: A man falls in love and fights his brother for control of a winery.
		1. Due to 2 pathways - split premine
	4. Good: Through the love of a good woman, a man defeats his brother for control of a winery.
	5. What is my hero's basic action?
	6. The Godfather: The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.
		1. Of all the actions Michael takes in that story, the one action that connects them all, the basic action, is that he takes revenge.
8. **Determine your hero's possible character change**
	1. Positive or negative (Godfather)
	2. Weaknesses x basic action = changed person
	3. basic action is the fulcrum
	4. weakness and change are opposites of the basic action
	5. The Godfather:
		1. Premise: The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.
		2. W—weaknesses at the beginning: unconcerned, afraid, mainstream, legitimate, separated from the family
		3. A—basic action: takes revenge
		4. C—changed person: tyrannical, absolute ruler of the family
		5. The Godfather is a perfect example of why you want to go to the opposites of the basic action to determine the weaknesses and change of your hero
		6. If Michael begins the story as a vengeful man, raking revenge on the men who shot his father will only make him seem more of the same. There's no character change. 
		7. But what if he starts off the opposite of vengeful? An unconcerned, afraid, mainstream, legitimate man, separated from his Mafia family, who then takes revenge could become the tyrannical, absolute ruler of the family. This is a radical change, no doubt. But it is a totally believable one
9. **Figure out the hero's possible moral choice**
	1. central theme crystallizes in moral choice typically near the end of story
	2. theme is your view of the proper way to act in the world
	3. it is your moral vision and one of the main reasons you are writing this story
	4. moral argument - author makes the case for how to live, not through philosophy but through the actions of characters going after a goal
	5. Don't give a **fake choice** - between a positive and negative i.e. jail or the girl
	6. Good: choice between love and honour (detectives choose honour)
10. **Gauge the audience appeal**
	1. Is this single storyline unique enough to interest a lot of people besides me?
	2. be ruthless as it is about commercial appeal
	3. write for yourself first, but not only for yourself

# Creating Your Premise
- **Premise**: Write down your premise in one sentence. Ask yourself if this premise line has the makings of a story that could change your life.
- **Wish List and Premise List**: Write down your wish list and your premise list. Study them together to identify the core elements of what you care about and enjoy.
- **Possibilities** Look for what is possible in the premise. Write down options.
- **Story Challenges and Problems** Describe as many of the story challenges and problems that are unique to your idea as you can think of.
- **Designing Principle** Come up with the designing principle of your story idea. Remember that this principle describes some deeper process or form in which the story will play out in a unique way.
- **Best Character** Determine the best character in the idea. Make that character the hero of your premise.
- **Conflict** Ask yourself "Who is my hero fighting, and what is he fighting about?"
- **Basic Action** Find the single cause-and-effect pathway by identifying a basic action that your hero will take in the story.
- **Character Change** Figure out the possible character change for your hero, starting with the basic action (A) and then going to the opposites of the basic action to determine his weaknesses (W) at the beginning and his change (C) at the end.
- **Moral Choice** List a moral choice your hero may have to make near the end of the story. Make sure it's a difficult but plausible choice.
- **Audience Appeal** Ask yourself if your premise is likely to appeal to a wider audience. If not, go back to the drawing board.  

**Tootsie (Example):**
- **Premise** When an actor can't get work, he disguises himself as a woman and gets a role in a TV series, only to fall in love with one of the female members of the cast.
- **Possibilities** You could take a funny look at the modern dating dance, but also dissect the deep immorality that underlies how men and women act toward each other in the most intimate part of their lives.
- **Story Challenges** How do you show the effect of men's immoral actions against women without seeming to attack one entire gender while making the other gender look innocent?
- **Problems** How do you make a man believable as a woman, weave several man-woman plots together and make them one, end each plotline successfully, and make an emotionally satisfying love story while using a number of farce techniques that place the audience in a superior position?
- **Designing Principle** Force a male chauvinist to live as a woman. Place the story in the entertainment world to make the disguise more believable.
- **Best Character** Michael's split between dressing as both a man and a woman can be a physical and comical expression of the extreme contradiction within his own character.
- **Conflict** Michael fights Julie, Ron, Les, and Sandy about love and honesty.
- **Basic Action** Male hero impersonates a woman
- **Character Change**: W— Michael is arrogant, a liar, and a womanizer. C— By pretending to be a woman, Michael learns to become a better man and capable of real love.
- **Moral Choice** Michael sacrifices his lucrative acting job and apologizes to Julie for lying to her.

# My Premise Exercise:

**Possibilities**
- A coming of age story for marginalized Canadians
- An opportunity to explore 2 cultural traditions - East & West
- Paint protagonist into a tighter & tighter corner

**Story Challenges
- Story takes place over the better part of a decade
- Show the development of a child to a man in thought process
	- Need to keep close watch of narrative voice of main POV
- Protagonist has similarities to me so need to ensure I maintain impartial to his fate

**Problems**
- Risky subject matter (racism, misogyny) needs to handled with care
- Need to ensure moral choice is not a no-brainer by the end

**Designing Principle**
- Instead of studying in school, the boy writes a new curriculum for the streets
- book vs street smarts trope
- writing down in journal which gets stolen - snitch or competitive advantage
- **Tell the story like a school curriculum**
	- Title chapters after grades (Grade 3, Grade 10 (again), 1st Year University)
	- Make connections between traditional Canadian curriculum & what the characters are encountering i.e. Quebec separatism & Khalistan
	- Chapter titled 'Long Division' - that features a seperation
- **The story is told as a school curriculum, with scholastic concepts woven in with street lessons** 

**Best Character**
- Is it Happy or Saad?
- Case for Happy:
	- Better fit for showing the progression from nerd to gangster
	- **The sidekick's story** - not often told
	- Consigliere
	- Make reference to [[Tom Hagen]] of the [[Godfather]]
- Case for Saad:
	- More directly involved with gang activity
	- More at stake (risk to life)
	- Harder to write due to own experience
- **The winner is Happy**

**Conflict**
- Happy is fighting Saad for control of his future life

**Basic Action** 
 - Writes a curriculum for the streets as he does petty crimes

**Character Change**
- W - Happy is naive, self-centred & sheltered. C - by writing about his street learnings, Happy becomes humble, selfless & wiser.

**Moral Choice**
- Happy must choose between his social circle & independence

**Additional Notes**
- Book vs Street Smarts trope
- The story is about two types of intelligence - their limitations & interactions
