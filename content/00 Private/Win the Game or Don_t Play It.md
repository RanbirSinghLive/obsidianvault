"The reason to win the game is so you can be free of it"

All of life can be classified into games: school, college, getting girlfriends, career, friends, investing, home ownership etc.

These are all multiplayer

A few things are single player games - i.e. meditation.

Don't get stuck playing games once you've won, if you're not happy doing it. [[You only have one life]]

Two ways to get out of playing a game
1. Don't Play It
	1. If you don't engage, you've kind of already won
2. Play & Win - choose your games very carefully

You have to know when to stop

These multiplayer games are well designed to keep you playing permanently.
