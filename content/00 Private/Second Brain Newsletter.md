Create a weekly (monthly?) newsletter that has:

- a snapshot of my weekly 2nd brain graph extension (names visible)
- a pic of the week's growth highlighted within the overall second brain
- drilldown to notable things I learned that week
- any surprising connections I made
- any changes to my second brain system
