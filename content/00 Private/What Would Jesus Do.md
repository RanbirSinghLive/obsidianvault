Instead of setting goals, do this technique instead.

Goals are inflexible to the current situation. Planning is impractical due to the sheer number of variables that human's can't compute.

Steps:
1. Pick someone who's values you want to embody, or create a mental image of the person you want to be
2. When you're faced with a situation where the action is unclear, think 'what would X do?'

This technique is used by Christians to great effect, but has secular use cases too.
