## Lesson: Art isn't practical

I went to an inner-city high school in Rexdale, Toronto.

Michael went there decades before me when the school population was whiter.

The 12th graders were busy applying for scholarships to help out with university tuition.

Everything was based on grades or identity.

There were scholarships for the top 5 students, for black students, for Indian students.

Then one day on the announcements they spoke of a new scholarship, sponsored by Michael, president of a big research firm.

It was contrarian.

It was for 11th graders iso 12th. It was for writing 1 short story. That's it.

Creative writing was one of the few things I was disproportionately better than my classmates at.

I also saw an opportunity for an asymmetric bet. Writing one good, 5 pages short story could result in 1 full year of tuition. That was a much better deal that 4 years of top percentile scholastics, which I'd already missed the boat on due to grade 9, where I frequently skipped class to drink vodka coolers & inhale 2nd hand weed smoke.

My father worked general labour and my mum stayed at home due to her arthritis. I could use the money.

I thought about what I'd write. I recall the instructions ruling out anything sci-fi, and centering it in the reality of growing up in Rexdale. But I didn't want to write a memoir of my woes, which felt like that other kids were doing when I overheard them speaking about it.

It was competitive, so people didn't want to reveal their strategy outright.

I decided I would write my truth - high testosterone and schoolyard fights amongst immigrant boys. And the fear of getting into one of those fights.

I needed a metaphor to tie it together, so I thought of the big door at the back of the school, and how it only opened from the inside and how you had to knock loud for someone on the other end to hear you, and you had to knock more than once.

I saw other kids writing out their story to the letter before the big day. I simply wrote out some bullet point highlights.

The game was to bring in any notes required and write the story in the computer lab for 1-2 hours.

I finished faster than any other kid. Usually when this happened I would feel insecure, but this time I had a shit-eating grin on my face.

We waited and waited.

The reveal day of the winner came and they brought us into the library.

Michael said there were a lot of good stories, but one stood out above the rest. My lip started quivering.

He called me up and shook my hand.

I overheard someone talking about it in the hallway the next day.

"I heard the guy who won wrote about *a door*."

It made me smile.

- Some people can't see the big in the small
- People didn't give a shit who the winner was, they just wanted to reconcile why they lost

I could've taken winning that contest as a cue to write more. Michael certainly hooked me up with mentors to make that happen.

But I didn't follow through. 

I was focused on getting a degree, getting into law school and somehow still fitting in with my substance abusing friends.

I acted like a 17-year-old.

Practicality won, but practicality isn't art.

I'm happy I'm getting into writing again.
