In defence of the middle

In a chess game, the openings and endgames are by the book. The middlegame is where the complexity lies.

In the corporate world, getting your foot in the door and running the company are where the focus in, and thus what the books are written about. Once you're in the mix, it's easy to get stuck in the middle as little help is centred around navigating byzantine hierarchies and proving your worth. The term 'middle management' is said with distaste by some of those above, below and outside of your organization.

I'm here to give the core of the management team the respect it deserves. 

The Peter principle states that people get promoted to the level of their incompetence. The principle paints the picture of ineffective hierarchies with people getting stuck as destiny. If there is truth to this, it is driven by workers getting management roles as a reward for doing their job well, instead of being 'management material.'

This may be fine if they were then trained in what it takes, but they're left to fend for themselves. This way, those who don't self-learn are left to suffer, along with those above and below them.

My goal is to help middle managers get the skills, relationships and mindset they need to win in the middle game.

From Chess: [Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_theory "Chess theory")Â on the middlegame is less developed than the opening or endgames. Since middlegame positions are unique from game to game, memorization of theoretical variations is not possible as it is in the opening. Likewise, there are usually too many pieces on the board for theoretical positions to be completely analyzed as can be done in the simpler endgames.

From wiki: Reuben Fine's view on middlegame is most imp factors are king safety, material and mobility.
