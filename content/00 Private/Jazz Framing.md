- Need proof supply of pilots is correcting
	- TC Monthly commercial pilot run rate
	- Any date from flight schools?
- Jazz-ALPA deal needs to be accepted by union & membership
	- What does membership want?
		- Seniority of Jazz workforce is artificially high for mid-future
		- Will dilute once we get to 30k hours
		- Senior workforce doesn't necessarily want to leave
		- Will get worse if pay falls way behind comparables
	- Jazz used to be the payway to AC
	- Now many more options available to AC, with better pay in the interim
	- Jazz needs to become more lucrative option to work way upwards
	- Tier 3 is paying pilots to stay longer
	- Tier 1 is paying pilots to come sooner
	- Jazz is squeezed in the middle
- Only pilots coming in the door are 750-1000 hour FOs
- Ops Reserve
	- 'normal' reserve still baked in
	- biggest risk is OAL attrition leaving lines uncovered mid-month
	- reducing OAL attrition will improve ops resiliency
- Captain Creation
	- Need pilots to want to become captains
	- Big risk - if majority coming in the door want to flow, why bother?
