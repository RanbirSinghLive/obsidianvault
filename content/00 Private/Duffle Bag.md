Making decisions when you’re at your lowest is tough.

Today I’m going to pick up my dad’s ashes.

I’ve been saying I’m going to pick up my dad but actually I’m going to pick up his remains. That is more accurate and less emotional.

When I was deciding about his cremation after his death, they asked me how he would want to be treated. We knew we wanted cremation, but my family asked if the funeral home could avoid grinding up his bones after the oven.

The director said that after the oven my father wouldn’t fit in an urn, but a duffle bag. Bones like his femur would still be mostly whole. If they were to give us him and we scattered him in a river, it would turn into a crime scene.

Jesus.

A simple question turns into more trauma. No one would’ve been ready for that. Her unequivocal answer probably came from being asked this same question by countless Indian families.

You don’t know when you’ve been hit for the past time. Pushing through comes with risks.
