# Audit:

-   Profile Pic
    -   Nice smile, background & photo quality
-   Banner
    -   Great banner
    - Do you want to mention footwear? it is your USP
    -   I would mimic the CTA to where you're directing people in the URL
        - 2 actions to get the same outcome may be confusing
-   Handle
    -   Shorten moniker after the | 
    -   My suggestion: Change Emoji to Sneaker, Scaling Sneaker Brands?
    - Doesn't need to be forever, but good for right now
-   Bio
    -   Needs to be shortened
        - Helping Accessory & Footwear Ecom Founders Attract & Retain Customers
        - Keep the client results part
-   Misc (occupation, location, website etc.)
    -   NA
-   Ratio
    -   Your follower-followed ratio is too high
    -   Unfollow unnecessary accounts
    -   We’ll move accounts you want to engage with to Lists later on
    -   We’re going to make your follows strategic
    -   Unfollow after you follow for an auto-DM
-   Pinned Tweet
    -   Focus on your offer & not your personality
    - Personality will be part of your trust building, but pinned tweet is part of funnel
    - Pin your giveaway tweet from the 17th of Feb for now
