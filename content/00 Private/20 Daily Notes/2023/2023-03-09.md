## Today's Notes:

- [x] #task sociability tips giveaway (networking) âœ… 2023-03-09

## Benjamin Sullivan
- Clients churning every 2 months
- Social media paid ads for Web3.0
- Web3 not a lot of businesses in the space
- These companies run short campaigns  - sprints not marathons
- Main reason for churn is product has launched
- Main objections
	- 15% price
	- majority is "some time to think"

What I've promised:
- build authority in your niche
- don't want to be seen as a marketing agency, but a growth partner for web3 crowds
- focus on creating a market of one
- 1st call is audit
- what is the main issues you're solving
- what is the pain point of your ICP?
