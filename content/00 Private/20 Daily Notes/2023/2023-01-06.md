### Justin Welsh Cold DM

Justin,

Just saying thanks for motivating me to start writing daily on Twitter.

You've given me tips each Saturday for most of 2022.

Listening to Danny's podcast, it was a bonus to hear you voice values that align with mine:

‚Ä¢ gratitude for the random chance that birthed us into good circumstances
‚Ä¢ giving people opportunities
‚Ä¢ family over legacy

It was a happy surprise.

Cheers,
Ranbir
