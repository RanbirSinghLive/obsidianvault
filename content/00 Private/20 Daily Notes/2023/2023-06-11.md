## Today's Notes:

- joins gang
- Too timid
- Teased
- Does homework to stay 
- Bullied
- Gang dissolves
- Lonely
- Tried regular life
- starts new gang
- Gets more intense 
- beef with rivals
- More risk
- Wants out 
- Can’t get out
- Betrays gang
- Alone

Starts alone and scared. Ends alone and brave.

A man must go it alone to truly be who he wants to be

A man can’t be who  he wants by living under someone elses shadow.
