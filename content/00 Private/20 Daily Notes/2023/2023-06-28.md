# Anthon's Case Study

Client: Vodafone

**Situation:** Vodafone is a major telecom company in XX. They had a mobile app built in 2 components. 

- Comp 1: Native app (downloadable from Store) 
- Comp 2: Web app

Those 2 components were storing data in 2 separate places.

As a result, they couldn't get a full picture of their business.

**Task:** Combine the data sources of both apps so they could analyze the entire customer journey.

**Action:** Both components has 2 different datalayers due to 2 different tag management protocols. I replaced one component's datalayer to match the other one.

Also, I needed to make sure User IDs were being passed through from the native app tracking to the website tracking, so that the analytics tool could ID the same user navigating between those 2 components.

**Result:** Now that this app data was in one place, it was easier for the analyst team to analyze journey and pinpoint the places that could be improved. They were able to improve the app journey and get better conversions.

But they have ONE big problem.

Data Segmentation.

Here's how I bridged the data gap for a *major company* in 4 steps.
