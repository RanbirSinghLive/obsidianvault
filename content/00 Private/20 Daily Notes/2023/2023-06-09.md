## Today's Notes:

- a novel should be an amplification of real life
- Readers don’t want their own lives
- Write what you know is wrong
- Only trouble is interesting 
- We write about common things because it’s easy
- If you don’t need to research, it’s probably going to be a boring novel
- Successful plots are big and bold, not a retelling of life
- All novels subtitle: the record of a prolonged struggle
