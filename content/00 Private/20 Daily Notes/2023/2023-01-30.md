**Problems Suffered Over the Past 2 years**

1.  Not knowing where to get started
2.  Creating a good offer - leading with value
3.  Shiny object syndrome
4.  Hiring
5.  Dealing with loneliness, ups and downs of being an entreprenuer
6.  Focusing too much on what other people do

# Pillars
- Scaling an Agency
	- Offers
		- Initially bought a big course in the space
		- If you give the same advice to 10k people, it'll skew the supply/demand behind it
		- course sellers have ulterior motives (upsells)
		- coming up with something unique is all Alpha 
	- Client Acquisition
	- Hiring
		- Hire when you need to, not when you want to
		- Overhiring
		- Hiring the right people
	- Systems
	- More than just acquiring clients
- Focus
	- Shiny Object Syndrome
	- Social Media Comparisons
	- Everyone jumps on the next fad (NFT, ChatGPT, Solar Panels)
	- To be successful, you need focus & high resiliency
	- Overcoming bad habits & putting all my energy into something worthwhile
	- You're never happy, you have moments of happiness
- The Entrepreneur's Journey
	- How To Start
		- I started on FB ads
		- niched from ecomm to SaaS
		- Then understood everyone was going the same thing
		- I'm much more passionate about helping agencies
	- Loneliness
	- Ups & Downs
		- People cancel contracts
		- You think things are going well & get a setback
		- Don't focus on the money, but on the value
		- Dealing with bad clients
			- Leaving, breaching contracts
- Freedom
	- Financial, Location & Time
	- Not entirely true
	- Very difficulty to sell without something of value to offer
	- Misconception - just need to sign clients
- The 9-5
	- I work way more now
- 99% in it for a quick buck
	- they do whatever is trending
	- I've limited my clients to focus on infrastructure & scale better later
- The best way to get people behind you is to post a lifestyle people want
	- Does it bait work? Maybe, but not for me
- Getting the right people to work with you
	- Get someone completely onboard with what you want to do
	- Believe on the vision
	- You can tell if someone wants to help or if they want a quick buck
- Putting in the work day in, day out
- Quitting is not an option

I'm Head of Content
- Sit down 1x weekly
- Questionnaire received
- Do Brand Audit
	- ICP
- Monday Head of Content

Client:
- Video ads only for ecommerce
	- He applies direct response marketing in them
- No YouTube
- ecom founders & agency owners only hire video editors
- they don't understand dir respo mkting
	- how can you make a buyer buy right now?
	- where he excels
- Ecom founders are his target audience
- Biggest problem: making a space for myself
- People hire media managers & a creative agency
	- His space is between these 2
	- They focus on UGC creators
		- they don't understand direct response marketing
- He wants to find the right audience
- Ecom founders & agency owners
	- Agency owners mostly hiring the talent vs collaboration
- He has 2 D2C founders. They run shopify stores
	- He has 1k retainers
	- They send him the raw content and fb data on what's performing well
	- He tries to replicate the ads
- What need does the biz owner have?
	- When you surpass certain rev, you hire agencies
	- They often hire for UGC content but it doesn't work
	- Your content is already sitting on your google drive, but you're not using it
	- He keeps attention until call to action
- He uses content that they say is not working, but he takes it & just puts it in a different order & cuts to make it work
- He can make the most $ of his videos
- He has 1 video testimonial from big leather jacket company
- screenshots of facebook ad analytics
- Screenshots are what he has
- GIVEAWAY: FREE AUDITs
	- send 2 videos edited and send it back
- Understand his pricing:
	- He charges monthly 
	- 1k for 20 video ads
	- they already have the content, they just send it to him
- get into UGC space, finding creators & sending them the script
	- he can upsell this by having a pipeline
- He got 1 client from Twitter on 1k retainer
	- Sending 10 messages everyday on Twitter
- We want to lead with value & then ask for stuff

Asks from him:
- few examples of case studies
- few example videos
- video testimonials
- he sells on the solution, not the service
- need to understand what kind of content they will want
- he's very niched down, but need to get higher up for audience
- Creator agencies 4-5k/mo for UGC aggregation
	- source creators, write scripts, send to client
	- they spend 2k on delivery
- Instead of selling long turnaround - (6 weeks for above),  we avoid that
- How are you pitching on Twitter
	- I'm a D2C video editor, do you need help editing your ads?
	- 26% response rate
	- he is messaging very active twitter users
	- Sent 100 & closed 1 - good close rate
- in 6-8 weeks, want to get to $10k/mo
	- Then he can get an editor and focus on running 
	- Meetings will be recorded going forward

**1) Have a crystal clear understanding of who your ideal customer is**

**2) Write out all their pains, fears, and frustrations**

**3) Create content that SOLVES their pains, fears, and frustrations**
