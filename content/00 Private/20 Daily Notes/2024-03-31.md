## Today's Notes:

- Progress: 14>26k
- Word Tracker: Manual + Todoist Reminder
- Canvas: Too busy, prefer full screen view
- Notes page: Working as designed
- Dataview Page: Unncessary
- Table - worked well, but didn't scale
	- Ghost rows
	- Long load times
- DB Folder was the answer
	- Mimicked Table perfecty with lightning fast load
	- Can add rows from templates
	- Makes Metadata menu less important
	- edit metadata super easy
	- wordcount sum makes dataview query obsolete
	- filter for chars, plots
	- data too clunky due to picker
	- draft number helps focus
- Also have one for characters with inline image
- Hover editor is nice add
- Will use Longform in the end to compile, but useless atm
