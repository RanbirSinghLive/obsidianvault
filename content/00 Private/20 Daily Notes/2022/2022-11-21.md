Tonight I am high.

I should primarily remind myself that writing while high doesn't become publish-worthy while you're high.

I've spent many of the last months trying to grow on Twitter & become a better writer.

I need to catalog how much I'm still consuming content on the plan vs just doing the plan.

I need to lock in & forget about newsletters, and just build.

I need to:
1. Write first thing in the morning
2. Understand I'll get bored
3. Engage with people more systematically
4. DM more people (via scrape)

Habit changes:
- put Oculus downstairs
- wake up at 7
- write before engagement

What am I going to write about/sell?

Sell comes first
- Writing services
- DFY or DWY
- DWY will set me apart
- I can downsell to ghostwriting, profile optimization etc

What will be the product
- DWY Writing Problem to get you ready for digital writing
- Content sprints as later meet-ups

What do people need to do to succeed at digital writing?
- Consistent topic, consistent schedule, consistent engagement
- What leads to this?
	- Accountability

My coaching service will be upscale accountability

- Program consists of:
	- Prework
	- Joint Session
	- Postwork/prework
	- Joint Session

Dream Outcome:
- A honed in niche, endless content ideas, posting schedule, buffer of content, time efficient processes

Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
- If I can do it, they can to
- Proof of my own consistency (charts)

Time Delay
- 66 days
	- https://jamesclear.com/new-habit
	- apparently how long Science takes to build a new habit

Effort & Sacrifice
- The program will be grueling but I'll make it so fun that you won't feel like it's boring

Can sell the product at different tranches
- Intensive, multiple calls a week to stay on track - high price
- Moderate - 2x calls per week - mid level
- Minimalist (80/20) - lower price

- Give these corporate names - branding

This is the lead magnet, newsletter, trust builder all-in-one:
- I can start by putting it together as a free email course packed with so much value.
- I can make it an email course that people can subscribe to as we go
- People can stay cutting edge, but for the earlier newsletters, I will rework them based on feedback

- Newsletter pitch - instead of learning something random each week, they can take on this course
	- Lesson 1 will be to turn off newsletters & focus on writing
	- The lessons have themes, where one day of week is check in with the coach & me providing examples of feedback I've given

- Prompts along the way for people to email me and
	- ask for feedback on tweets, schedules etc.
	- offer them to join the coached program

- The beauty
	-  I am writing the course as I write the newsletter
	- I am teaching a real skill
	- I can showcase my own writing in the meantime & it'll serve as my portfolio
	- I can still target operations/management folks because I know them best

- On website, start with free email course at the top
- Just need to figure out how to:
	- Send people to front of email course if they want to re-start
	- Have everyone start at the beginning of the email sequence
	- List the lessons on the website if people want to speed-run
		- "I believe everyone can start at their own pace"
	- They can select what they know already if they want to accelerate
		- Check if their familiar with Twitter
		- Linkedin
		- Grammar/Style
	- This is too fancy for right off the bat
	- First thing is to position them in line with my own learnings
