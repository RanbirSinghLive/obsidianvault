## Today's Notes:

There are modes of writing to my system
- Hive mind writing
	- This is my engagement and tweet drafting
- Air gapped writing 
	- This is when I take to myself and create original, longer form thought
- Feedback from JOSHUA GEELEN
	- Remove random stuff from twitter banner
	- Make banner text more personal - just reword it
	- bio: 
		- Guiding writers to online growth with (unique focus: personality for me) and self-management | Building my digital garden at
		- use blue of my banner as my background
- Website Idea:
	- have mini-courses that lead people through learning
	- hashtags are great ways to have related notes pop-up that don't deserve a heading on the sidebar
