- [ ] Make North Star Strategy Sheet

Build out a 10-12 week strategy that includes: 

- Goal
- Timeline
- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Performance indicators
- What might get in the way 

You're not building a 1-year plan. This strategy's function is to ground you in your "next level" when things get loud.
