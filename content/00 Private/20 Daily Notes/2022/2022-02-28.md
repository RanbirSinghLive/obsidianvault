# Hello World

This is my first note in [[Obsidian]]. 

I'm trying out Obsidian to recentre on my love of writing and creativity.

I previously wrote within [[Notion]], which I found to be clunky as a writing-first tool.

Prior to that, I found Google Docs to note be good at linking writing to other parts of your workflow.

I'm now coming to Obsidian to try bi-directional linking to see if it works for me as a form of [[Personal Knowledge Management]].
