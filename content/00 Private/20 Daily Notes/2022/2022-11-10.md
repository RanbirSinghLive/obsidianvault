- So now I've got shiny object syndrome and want to start writing on Linkedin
- This stems from not getting a lot of traction Twitter & recalling the dopamine that I got from my novel niche a while ago
- Would I take my content operations niche to Linkedin?
	- It could cause friction at work
	- Starting from 0 would require a lot of work
- Instead, I should just be my work self on Linkedin
- My work self has gotten me a lot of success in life
- I don't need to reinvent the wheel, if my work life & my content life are aligned, it won't be an issue
- In the end, what am I trying to do?
	- I'm happy with the work/life balance that my job provides
	- I want to stay there a long time
	- I like the problems I'm solving
	- But I also want to write for a living
	- I can do that on Linkedin

- Dickie's Advice
- The stuff that performed best on LinkedIn was: 
- Actionable (because people are there to learn)
- Aspirational (because people posting their stories on LinkedIn is rare, which makes them more engaging).

- The most important part of LinkedIn is the hook
- You get 5 lines to hook the reader and get them to click "see more." 
- And the algorithm takes someone clicking "see more" as signal to share it with more people

- Lastly, LinkedIn rewards content that sparks engagement and conversation
- The more people that have conversations in the comments of your post, the more viral it goes
- So at the end of every post, I ask people to hit reply with a question or big takeaway
- Then I answer them!
