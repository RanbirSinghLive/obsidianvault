Triplex Story:

An immigrant family moves into a home in Montreal and lives many to the unit to be able to afford it. They buy off a Quebecois who views them with some disdain.

The Quebecois buys the place after working for years as a mechanic and moves in with his wife. They buy off an English family fleeing Montreal due to the seperatist waves

The English family built (or helped) to build the place initially. The place is a slumhouse that houses multiple families that work in the dirty industry on the canal.

The land is passed by the local indigenous people to PSC.
