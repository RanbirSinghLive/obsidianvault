Product Idea:
- Make a composite course out of all of my writing coaching threads
	- In Notion makes the most sense
	- Obsidian will alienate most (tool friction)

Offer:
- Free 30 min discovery call to discuss your digital writing goals & see if we're a fit

I need to find the best home for my writing.

Obsidian Publish offers a good option and shows the values that I want to display (productive, techie, networked thinker)
