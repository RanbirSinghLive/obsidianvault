So I'm trying to figure out how to maintain my writing habit with next week's YYZ project in the works. It'll require even earlier mornings but I need to be realistic about what we'll see play out.

I need to split my time between mornings and evenings. I think I can count on Mohamed being my #2 and working opposite me.

Ideas:
- Bucket out old problems vs new problems
- Old problems are still underlying influence, but what new problems are compounding the situation
