## Justin Welsh

AM1: Tweet a simple 4 or 5-step tip that’s easy to implement.
AM2: Tweet an easily consumable, and helpful listicle.
PM: Ask a great question that you’d like answered.

## Kieran Drew

My rule is: 
1 story-based tweet that inspires/educates. 
1 value-based tweet that gets results. 
1 tweet that shows how I think.
