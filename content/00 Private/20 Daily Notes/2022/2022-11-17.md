So I was on this bus in LA. And it was, I was really nervous because like a bus and like a big bus network. I was late at night. I was trying to get somewhere. So get on the bus. It's for like every seat is taken except for let's see, I sit down, and two guys and a girl. They look into her Lamine next to me. They turned to me and they said, Do you want to play a game? I was reluctant, but to kind of forced me into it. So they pulled out a piece of paper and they said you need to remember these five words.

And it was a gibberish and then they put it away quickly and I'm like, I don't know if I can remember that. And let go. Don't worry, you will suddenly count down from three. And at the end of the three second countdown, I'm hoping I can remember the words. And this whole time the rest of the bus has been that quiet and they do on their own day and they think ignoring us which you know usually happens when there's people that bothered someone on a bus everyone else's like pretends to do their own thing. But then so is it on the three second countdown.

In unison the rest of the bus turns to me, it starts saying the words in sync.

It was super creepy.
