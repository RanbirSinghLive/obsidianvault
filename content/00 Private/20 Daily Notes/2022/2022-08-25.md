When does my story start?

- 3rd grade too early
- Perhaps at beginning of 8th grade with bike stolen?
- What do I want to show before meeting Saad?
	- Innocence
	- Know-it-all
	- Restrictive (nurturing) home life
	- immature friends
	- bottom of totem pole
- prelude: summer break before 8th grade - bike stolen, gangsters all around, ramneet's birthday
- set-up: starting at 8th grade home room with overwhelmed teacher & abrasive students
- trigger incident: Saad & Happy get teamed up in class
- Desire: Happy tags along with Saad at lunch

Timeline:
- 8th Grade - Act 1
- Grade 9-11 - internal struggles when left alone, agency work, Sikh identity
- Grade 12-Year 1 - first battle
- Year 2 - painted into corner
- Year 3 - final battle

Saad is Ally turned Opponent
Initial Opponent is nerd friend turned enemy of new lifestyle - wants Happy to be subservient to him, but now Happy playing new game. Sympathetic as he has a point about the new game being dangerous
2nd Opponent is Ali - bully from within gang
Saad is friend throughout both struggles & fights the battles for Happy
All this leads Happy deeper into Saad's web, who then becomes controlling of Happy as well once his priorities shift to life beyond petty crime to organized crime
