Today I'll be getting my first physical (probably) ever. The process will last 3-4 hours. I am a bit nervous they will find something worrying as I haven't had a check-up via family doctor in a few years. The recent passing of my father also makes me prone to thoughts of my [[mortality]] and the precarious nature of our lives.

My physical went well. My doctor, Howard Goldstein, suffered a fatal heart attack in 2020. He died in the back of an ambulance and was recusitated back to life. In the following year, both of his daughters got married, in small ceremonies due to COVID. They wanted to get married with their father present.

Howard was a delight to be around and really seemed to be trying to get the most out of the new life he'd just been given. He is on the waitlist for a new heart. In the meantime, he is plugged into a battery for his heart pump. He carries the battery around in a satchel. Second chances should be cherished.
