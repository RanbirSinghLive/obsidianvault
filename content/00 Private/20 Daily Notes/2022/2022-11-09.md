- Think of [[Alex Hormozi]]'s quote: If you don't know what product to make, keep creating content. Your followers will tell you what they want
- Content Operations - systems for operators to create Twitter content with a demanding schedule
- Do the high leverage work first
	- Engage
		- My current plan is too focused on high follower accounts
		- They get me impressions, but need to couple that with low follower accounts
		- 1-2k follower accounts are best
		- Look at their followers to see who else is available
		- DM 5 accounts a day
	- Write
		- Look at ways to improve the use of Hypefury & potentially switch to Tweethunter if it's got better support for being used as a all-in-one writing tool
	- Publish Tweets & Threads
		- I've been enjoying writing threads. Keep it up & allows me to riff on a topic more
		- I potentially switch to writing thread alone, perhaps 1x daily
		- Threads switch me from Platitudes to Value
- Think of securing domain name in contentoperations vein
	- contentoperations.io
	- contentoperations.co
	- contentoperations.app

- QK FOPS Reduction
	- Waterfall to be provided by Jazz
	- Need to understand the factors at play & our call on how they'll trend
	- Feb looks slightly oversubscrbied in Budget
	- Reasons:
		- Vacation req over by 1k hours
		- Creating CA capacity in the West but pilots won't bid to move/DH to East
		- Training plan changed 3 times on account of flpw
		- Difficulty hiring direct entry CAs
			- Wanted 10 this month but got 2
	- Addtional risks
		- Attrition at 10-15 a month & they're forecasting 4
		- e of people wanting to come to Jazz vs wait 6 months & go to AC
		- Do we go to 105? Does it make economic sense
		- Small overhead at Jazz compared to workload
