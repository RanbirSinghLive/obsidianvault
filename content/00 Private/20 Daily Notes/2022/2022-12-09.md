## Tweets:

Do you get a funny feeling when you can tell someone isn't genuine?

Your audience gets that feeling too.

They can see right through you.

Give them more credit & write like the real you.

I was reading 20 newsletters & posting 3 tweets a day.

But my goal was to grow on Twitter...

Now I'm reading 3 newsletters & posting 6 tweets a day.

Filter your information diet to help, not hinder your goals.

Writing tweets is easy if you're posting good comments on other content.

Just tweak them into top-level tweets & schedule them for next week.

Why next week?

1. People don't like seeing the same thing 2x a day
2. People forget the lesson in a week

Meet Julie Powell.

In 2002, she wrote a blog where she cooked 524 recipes from the same cookbook in 1 year.

It was a hit & she bagged a book deal.

That book was turned into the hit movie Julie & Julia.

Digital writing leverage is older than you think.

Social media is a status game by default.

How to play a different game:
