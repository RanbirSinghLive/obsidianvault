# Fractal Fiction, 1 Million YouTube Views and Chasing a Beautiful World

Welcome back, here are 4 ideas I'm obsessing over this week

- Fractal Fiction
- How To Be Egotistical Enough To Do Great Work
- Beautiful World, Where Are You by Sally Rooney
- How The Market Whisperer Blew Up On YouTube

# Fractal Fiction

Obsidian allows users to create non-fiction notes without a hierarchy or chronology. Why can't we take the learnings from this process to create works of fiction? I think we're stuck with chronology, as stories are transformation arcs by definition. But perhaps we can shed a set hierarchy? Fiction needs a beginning, middle and end. But why can't we start at a common beginning, but have multiple middles and ends? This way, one story thread can have multiple fractals towards varied conclusions. The choose-your-own-adventure novel genre works like this already. But moving it to a digital medium allows any reader to fork the narrative to their liking:

# How To Be Egotistical Enough To Do Great Work

Ego gets a bad rap. Too much ego indeed leads to bad outcomes. But too little ego leads to inaction. We are all capable of great work, but need a little ego to get us going. Ego is simultaneously defined as self-esteem and self-importance, but those are 2 very different things. I think they represent two portions of a larger ego spectrum:

If we abstract ego as being our perceived ability at a task, we can find a relation with the risk we're wrong:

# Beautiful World, Where Are You by Sally Rooney

Sally Rooney's Normal People is one of my favourite novels of recent years. The follow-up still has her signature style but switches it up enough to keep things fresh. The novel swaps between 2 characters and first/third person to great effect. Here is my favourite excerpt:

On the platform of a train station, late morning, early June: two women embracing after a separation of several months. Behind them, a tall fair-haired man alighting from the train carrying two suitcases. The women un-speaking, their eyes closed tight, their arms wrapped around one another, for a second, two seconds, three. Were they aware, in the intensity of their embrace, of something slightly ridiculous about this tableau, something almost comical, as someone nearby sneezed violently into a crumpled tissue; as a dirty discarded plastic bottle scuttled along the platform under a breath of wind; as a mechanised billboard on the station wall rotated from an advertisement for hair products to an advertisement for car insurance; as life in its ordinariness and even ugly vulgarity imposed itself everywhere all around them? Or were they in this moment unaware, or something more than unaware-were they somehow invulnerable to, untouched by, vulgarity and ugliness, glancing for a moment into something deeper, something concealed beneath the surface of life, not un-reality but a hidden reality: the presence at all times, in all places, of a beautiful world?

A great late summer read.

# How The Market Whisperer Blew Up On YouTube

I'm a degenerate YouTube binger. I habitually refresh my home page for new video essays to watch at 2x speed while I wash dishes. The Market Whisperer's premiere video hung around after multiple refreshes. This was enough to get me to watch it. Upon a closer look, I was fascinated at how the first video of a new channel could capture the YouTube algorithm so completely. I wrote a thread about the video here.

The Market Whisperer has inspired me to create a video essay of my own, on my favourite book this year - The Swerve. Stay tuned for updates on that!
