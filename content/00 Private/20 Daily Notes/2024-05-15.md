## Today's Notes:

- All CR9s will gradually have IFE screens removed over the next 2 months
- We will begin gradually removing all IFE screens from the E75 fleet later in the summer
- Aircraft will be fitted with blanking plates at each seat
- Given this reality, May will be the last month of new content loaded onto the screens
- Beginning in June, all E75s and most CR9s and E75s will recieve GOGO IFE in line with our Rouge product. Customers will be able to access an offering of entertainment by logging in on their own devices
- The AC digital team is reviewing an email notification that will be sent to pax upon check-in for flights operated by these fins
