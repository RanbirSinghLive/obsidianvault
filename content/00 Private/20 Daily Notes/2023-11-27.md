Bernard joined the Regional Airlines team in February and immediately delivered value. He excelled in providing operational oversight of PAL and Jazz YYZ operations. I quickly came to rely on Bernard's insight and expertise on these matters. His decades of compounded experience and relationships helped solve issues and get our team a real picture of the situation.

Bernard was also an eager learner. While his competency on non-operational matters is still developing, he never misses an opportunity to ask questions and develop.

I have been able to leave Bernard in charge while I'm on vacation and have felt reassured that critical issues would be dealt with either directly, or in conjunction with other branch leaders, with whom Bernard works very well.

I concur that Bernard greatest accomplishment has been steering the ops aspects of the PAL launch and expansion. I've been confident in him to lead this initiative and report out as required. This was the lynchpin towards his exceeding expectations performance this year.

Bernard also serves as a great ambassador for AC with his many diversity and youth engagement interfaces. I look forward to him becoming more of an ambassador in Canada's regional markets in the same vane.

In terms of improvement, I would like Bernard to methodically keep track of action items. The Regional Airlines team deals with issues from every branch and priority level, so this is no easy feat. Bernard should improve his tracking systems at the task and project level to ensure he is comprehensive and able to provide digestible reports for myself and execs on the key files. He needs this competency to work more autonomously as time progresses.

A symptom of success is raising the bar, but Bernard knows that well! The growth curve of the Regional Airlines role is a multi-year one.

In order to exceed or far exceed expectations next year, Bernard will have to increase competency in all aspects of  CPA governance. In order for Bernard to hit that benchmark, he must strive to become more well-versed in the financial, commercial, and contractual aspects of CPA governance with Jazz and PAL. He can also offset this benchmark somewhat by being pivotal in the expansion of PAL to 6 covered aircraft and/or the launch of CPA operations with Landline. Making incremental progress towards all of these goals is no easy feat, and will be enough to exceed expectations. Achieving mastery in all or near all these aspects would be required to far exceed.

I look forward to working with Bernard in the years to come! Well done sir. It is a privilege to call you my colleague.
