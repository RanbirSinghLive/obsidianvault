Alcohol is a present danger in Punjab, so how society is structured shows this. In villages, the only place that is allowed to sell alcohol is the taika, or liquor store. The store is usually on it's own, outside the village limits, a 5 minute walk down the single lane road leading to the next village. No other commerce gets this treatment. The only thing out that is farmland and wells. 

They do this so that the illicit action of buying alcohol is out of sight. However, the impact it has on individuals and families is still seen quite frequently.
