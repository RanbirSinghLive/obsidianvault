[[John Truby]][[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft 

How will this novel change my life?

Wish List:
- **What would you like to see in a novel?**
- Growing up in Rexdale
- My life observations put to use
- the evolution of my neighbourhood over time
- big concept books
- learn chess through a fiction book
- a fiction book that makes you smarter
- a Sikh character that does bad things
- an honest portrayal of how shitty kids can be
- an easy-to-read narrative that is structurally very complex
- Wes Anderson style prose

Premise List:
- **Write every premise you've ever thought of**
- the last astronauts on the ISS witness earth destroy itself in nuclear war. Now the Americans & Russians must decide if they continue the war or work together
- My life growing up in Rexdale, turned up to 10
- A spy novel (Operator)
- A family lives skyscraper to skyscraper in Sao Paolo. They're haven't been on street level in years
- A young man foregoes cancer treatment and decides to spend his last years on his own terms, while blowing through an extensive inheritance
- Ceasefire in an ongoing conflict creates a tenuous peace that various characters exploit
- 4 guys travel to Thailand together & witness a society where everything is for sale
- Write a story with different perspectives where none of them repeat.Â  The story would have to be tricky to get some sort of symmetry by the end
- A bedouin meets a Djin in a cave and makes a deal for power

Look for things that repeat themselves:
- Male protagonist
- Exotic locales
- Magical realism
- Travel
- Action/Violence
- Drugs
- **Male friendships**
