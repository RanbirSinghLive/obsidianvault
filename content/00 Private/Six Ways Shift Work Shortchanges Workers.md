Working outside of the 'normal' Monday-to-Friday, 9-to-5 cycle has been touted as offering 'flexibility.' However, there are many downsides to shift work.

1. Shift work means working holidays.

While we all don't celebrate Christmas and Easter religiously, they are marquee secular meetups too.

2. Shift work hampers your social life.

Your regular days off could be Tuesday and Wednesday. This is in contrast to most of your friend circle being off on weekends. With a rotating schedule, its also tougher to plan regularly timed hobbies. If pottery class is Thursdays at 7pm, you might not make it every week.

3. Shift work wreaks havoc on relationships.

If your partner works 9-5 and you work night shifts you will only see each other when your days off align. This limits your quality bonding time and stunts relationship growth.

4. Shift work impacts your quality of sleep.

Getting up and going to bed at the same time each day meant wonders for my health. If you work a rotating mix of mornings, evenings and midnights, your sleep cycle will be in constant flux. 

5. Organizing childcare around shift work can be a nightmare.

Most public and private daycares operate in a rough overlap with 9-5 work schedules. If you work afternoons, that means you will have to find alternate forms of childcare, if possible.

6. Shift work often has rigid schedules.

With 9-5 jobs, it is often possible to leave work early and 'make it up' the next day. Shift work often centers around operational roles that must be filled continuously. You work/life flexibility may be hindered.

Consider these downsides before taking on shift work, or when contemplating shifting to 9-5.
