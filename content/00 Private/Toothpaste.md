One of my first jobs was working at a manufacturing plant, making toothpaste displays for storefronts.

That is actually giving myself too much credit.

I actually was tasked with cutting open boxes full of toothpaste cartons & emptying them into a tub so the next guy on the line could do something with them.

I was a human cog in a display assembling machine.

Doing this job meant waking up at 3am, walking to the local strip mall to be picked up by a school bus, which took us 1 city over to work.

It meant waiting for a merciful lunch time buzzer when we all crowded into a small room to take turns microwaving our sabji in the 30 minutes we had.

It means waiting again for a merciful end of shift bell so I could be done.

My colleagues were almost all recent immigrants to Canada.

I was a 2nd generation teen on summer break.

I relied on my mum getting me the job:

- I was too socially anxious to apply anywhere
- she knew this type of work from her own experience
- it paid minimum wage, but there was no accountability
- I could decide not to show up 1 day, and they'd take me back the next day as long as I had some semblance of an excuse
- I was only working for summer break, so a 'better' job would require interviewing & other hoops I didn't have patience for
- I didn't need to deal with food prep, as I was self-concious of my growing beard and body hair
- I didn't need to deal with customers, given the  social anxiety above

I was standing at the end of the production line, cutting open boxes with a box cutter & dumping their contents.

I was thinking about anything else.

The job was tiring but also meditative. The monotony allowed me to think about intricate fantasy worlds in which I was stronger, more confident & more handsome.

The foreman walked by & grabbed the tub from my hands just as I was about to pass it.

He held up a toothpaste carton that was slit open. There were 5 more just like it in the bin of 30-odd.

He held it, looked at me & said "do this again & you're fired."

I whispered an "OK"

I had been slicing into the cardboard too strong & the box cutter was cutting through the middle stack of toothpaste cartons as well.

Cutting the boxes open gentler would fix this, but it would also require me to be more mindful, which would require me to fantasize while standing up less.

I did my best. The school year was around the corner anyway.
