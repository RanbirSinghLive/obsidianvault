This week, I will teach you why I keep writing my debut novel even though no one will read it.

My novel progress stalled this week. Life got busy & I compromised my routine. After a few missed sessions, I questioned the point of writing.

My debut novel seemed like an impossible goal. 

Writing is a lonely process. Despite my advice to write in public, we all start out with no audience. Why continue?

I found my 'why' by making writing a single-player game.

Unfortunately, many people don't because they're geared towards external motivation.

## External motivation is giving up control to:
- Likes
- Followers
- Book Sales

All these validators come & go at the whim of others. If others don't show up, you're sunk.

Here's how to change your mindset:

## Don't take yourself so seriously.

Your first novel will be awful.

You're a writer-in-training. There's no beginner's luck when writing 60,000 words. Instead of letting this probability defeat you, consider it a baseline to beat. 

Making a classic novel is over-rated anyway.

It's futile to achieve permanence in the literary canon. On the scale of the universal timeline, humanity is minuscule. Your life is imperceptible, let alone your novel.

Enjoy your writing hobby for what it is.

## Write to learn.

You're trying to write something that'll change your life.

That involves learning new things. Writing an autobiographical novel is a good way to understand your childhood. Writing a romance novel is a good way to explore love. 

Everything you learn will stack into wisdom that will ripple out through your life.

## The task is the goal.

Controversial take: Writers should enjoy writing.

It won't *all* be fun but if it's all pain, why are you doing it to yourself? Find a way to make writing fun in & of itself, even if it's after the fact. Dorothy Parker may have said, "I hate writing, but loved having written."

Enjoying the act of writing can lead to a flow state, which can lead to hitting your writing goals faster.

## Prove it to yourself.

Show that you can do something scary & grand.

Ex-Navy Seal David Goggins says most of us only live at 40% of our true capabilities. We need to callous our minds to go further. This requires consistently going past your pain tolerance. Sit at your desk, especially when you don't want to.

Nobody cares about your novel... except you. That's a start.

## Pre-CTA:
Why do I keep writing a novel that nobody cares about?

Intrinsic over extrinsic motivation.

1. Learning over likes
2. Fun over followers
3. Mindset over money

Tomorrow, I'll show my subscribers how I look inwards to keep going.

Writing is a lonely pursuit.

Despite our best efforts to build an audience...

Writing a newsletter with no audience is awkward & lonely.

It's also the easiest problem to solve.

1. Send it to your spouse.
2. Post it to your social media.
3. Email it to Ali Abdaal (his offer)

Write to your 1st subscriber & go from there.

Trying to avoid the pitfalls of burnout & apathy?                                  

The perfect landing spot is exactly between them.                  

Let me explain:                                       

Optimal output requires taking on tasks at the edge of your capabilities.

This is known as the Hebbian-Yerkes-Dodson Law:

- Tasks that trigger no stress response lead to boredom (or apathy)
- Tasks that overload lead to anxiety (or burnout)
- Tasks that challenge you *just enough* tend to elicit your best performance

Seek out discomfort to grow.
