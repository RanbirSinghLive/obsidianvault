The **McNamara fallacy** (also known as the quantitative fallacy) named for [Robert McNamara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara "Robert McNamara"), the [US Secretary of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense") from 1961 to 1968, involves making a decision based solely on quantitative observations (or [metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_metric "Performance metric")) and ignoring all others. The reason given is often that these other observations cannot be proven.

> The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can't be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can't be easily measured really doesn't exist. This is suicide.

The fallacy refers to McNamara's belief as to what led the United States to defeat in the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War")—specifically, his quantification of success in the war (e.g., in terms of enemy [body count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_count "Body count")), ignoring other variables.

### The Vietnam War

The McNamara fallacy originates from the Vietnam War, in which enemy body counts were taken to be a precise and objective measure of success. War was reduced to a mathematical model: By increasing estimated enemy deaths and minimizing one's own, victory was assured. Critics note that [guerrilla warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare"), widespread resistance, and inevitable inaccuracies in estimates of enemy casualties can thwart this formula. McNamara's interest in quantitative figures is seen in [Project 100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_100,000 "Project 100,000"): by lowering admission standards to the military, enlistment was increased. Key to this decision was the idea that one soldier is, in the abstract, more or less equal to another, and that with the right training and superior equipment, he would factor positively in the mathematics of warfare.

US Air Force Brigadier General [Edward Lansdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lansdale "Edward Lansdale") reportedly told McNamara,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy#cite_note-3) who was trying to develop a list of metrics to allow him to scientifically follow the progress of the war, that he was not considering the feelings of the common rural [Vietnamese people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people"). McNamara wrote it down on his list in pencil, then erased it and told Lansdale that he could not measure it, so it must not be important.
