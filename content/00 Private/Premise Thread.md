Your novel won't resonate if your premise is paper-thin.

Common traps for new novelists:

-   Too shallow
    
-   Directionless
    
-   Not compelling
    

Instead, take advice from an expert in the field, John Truby.

1/Write a novel that could change your life.

Look for ideas with internal resonance. If no one else reads it, telling the story will at least benefit you. Your idea should only feel bigger the more you ponder it.

# â€œI write entirely to find out what I'm thinking" - Joan Didion

2/Ideate.

Make a wish list of all the things you've wanted to read in a novel but haven't found. Make a list of all the novel premises you've ever thought up before. Look for words & themes that repeat.

Then pick a tentative premise & distill it into 1 sentence.

3/Explore the possibilities.

What are the expectations of a story like this? What may you be promising the reader?Â 

Ask yourself 'what if...?'

This will lead you deeper into your writer's mind & into the world of the story you're proposing.

**4/Look for potential roadblocks.**

What challenges could you face in writing this narrative?

Does it need:

â€¢ many changes in POV?

â€¢ extensive historical research?

â€¢ creating sympathy for an unlikeable character?

Tackle these head-on.

The next step is critical...

5/**Find the designing principle**

This is for telling your story with a deeper process or structure. Uniqueness is key.

For example:

Premise: Orphan boy learns piano to find self-worth.

Design Principle: Story told in juxtaposition to Beethoven's lost autobiography.

**6/Who's giving you main character energy?**

Determine who is the most interesting character in your idea. Make them the star, even if they're not the most likable.

If you can't find a compelling character in your idea, question if you should pick a new one.

7/**Pinpoint the conflict.**

**Who is your star fighting against and why?**

This is what you're story is really about.

**8/Determine the basic action.**

This is the central equation in your story. Point A leads to B, which leads to C... all the way to Z.

Think cause & effect, or laying out the spine of your story.

**9/Make sure your star changes over time.**

Your star is one kind of person to begin with.

Then they undertake the basic action.

Finally, your star comes out changed, for better or worse.

There should be clear opposition between the 2 versions of your star.

**10/Impose a moral choice.**

**Your star needs to make a difficult choice near the end of the story.**

**Marriage or Jail isn't a moral choice.**

**Marriage or Money is.**

**11/Audience Appeal**

This is important but last for a reason

Once you've thoroughly explored the premise, step back and take a critical look at its mass appeal. If it doesn't make sense, start all over again

Take the time to choose wisely & once
