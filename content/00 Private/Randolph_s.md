I was frustrated that everyone at the board game meetups was always in a different mood.

Some were eager to jump into any game earnestly as a group and give it their best.

Some were laser focussed on one game had people they were already playing with. No social aspect at all. 

Some were super agro and didn't give any heed to the fact that some cooperation was needed.

Some didn't give a shit about gaming at all and just wanted to talk.

Turns out we were all playing different games all along

The games of teamwork, mastery, dominance and relato respectively.
