Dear Sarah,

You turn 30 years old today. This is a milestone birthday. Milestones are meant to make us reflect but they often make us anxious.

Humans like round numbers. 30 feels more significant than 29 or 31. However, it only feels that way because we let it.

Why can't we look at our lives through the lens of our own milestones?

To me, you haven't just turned 30 this year.

Here are some of your more meaningful recent milestones:

- Rediscovered your love of ceramics 
- Moved into your new forever home with me
- Earned the respect as a growing expert at work
- Overcome a year of adversity as a stronger woman

Today is a day to celebrate all of the above, and not solely an arbitrary number.

I promise that your 31st birthday will be even more momentous than your 30th.

And it only gets better from there!

With Undying love, 
Ranbir
