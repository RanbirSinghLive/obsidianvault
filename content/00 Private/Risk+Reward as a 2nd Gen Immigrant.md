1/ Here's what I've learned about risk and reward growing up as a second generation immigrant.

Please help let me know if these lessons resonate with you.

2/ Younger people are more inclined to take risk. 

Older people shift towards loss aversion.

My father immigrated at 31. My parents spent 7 years apart to make Canada work.

I changed career paths at 24. I moved cities at 27. 

I feel loss aversion slowly taking over.

3/ My dad came to Canada with $10. He passed away with $400,000. 

That's a 40,000x return on his life energy.

He did that without owning any stocks or real estate.

He had already taken his big risk coming here.

4/ Think in terms of Intergenerational leverage instead of wealth.

My dad leveraged labour and frugality to attain financial stability.

I leveraged financial stability to attain education and all the doors that unlocked.

Thank you dad.
