What would I be working towards if I were a billionaire?

Writing novels in my study from 7 am until noon and then being with my family.

Why not work towards that today?

I always sway back and forth between fiction & non-fiction. The Obsidian platform helps with both. [[Any author can fork the narrative.]]
