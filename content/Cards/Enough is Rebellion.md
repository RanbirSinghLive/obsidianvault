Having enough is a rebellious act. 

Having had enough to drink at a bar or enough to eat for lunch is rebellion against excess.

Scarcity and abundance exist on a continuum. Somewhere in the middle is 'enough.'

Scarcity makes us act in irrational ways, such as hoarding.

The desire for abundance is a bulwark against scarcity.

However, abundance has flaws of its own. Uncapped desire leads to perpetual unfulfillment.

Instead, it is possible to have 'enough' in all domains:

- Money
- Relationships
- Career
- Life

What is life after enough? It is the same as life after work. **Play**.

'Enough' is a mindset. The right mindset means making the right decisions. The right decisions compound to create *your* ideal life.

Having infinite aims with a finite lifespan is a recipe for unhappiness. Find your enough.
