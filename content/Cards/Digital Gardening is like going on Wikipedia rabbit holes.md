Sometimes I click on Wikipedia articles and am surprised at where I end up.

For example, here is a raw chain of hyperlinks from wikipedia: Frances Cleveland > First Lady of the United States > White House > Neoclassical architecture > Archaeology > Mesopotamia

This was taken from the first section of each posts, not necessarily digging too hard for outlandish links. I think upon reading them, they all make sense as fractals of the previous topic.

(This is a riff on the Hitler game, where 2 players compete to get to the wiki article on Hitler with the fewest clicks from a random page. From my starting point, I was able to get there in 2 clicks: Frances Cleveland > Worl
d War I > Adolf Hitler)

[[This is my digital garden]]. Digital gardens allow you to go on wikipedia benders, but through a person's notes instead. The dynamic of following your curiosity and making unlikely connections is the same though.
