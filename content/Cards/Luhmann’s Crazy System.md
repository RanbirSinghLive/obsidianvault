Niklas Luhmann wrote 70 books & 400 articles in 50 years.

Their topics ranged from art to economy.

And he owed it all to his elaborate note-taking system: 

He used 90,000 index cards stuffed in shoe boxes.

But you can recreate it online & 2x your writing output:

---
Luhman's system is known as a Zettelkasten or slip box.

Onlline tooks to recreate it include Roam Research & Logseq.

But I prefer Obsidian.

In this guide we'll refer to files, but keep in mind Luhmann did this all manually, which makes it even more extraordinary!

---

The Zettelkasten system contains 3 kinds of files:

1. Fleeting
2. Reference
3. Permanent

You'll want to set up 3 folders to house each of these seperately.

---

Fleeting files are akin to quick capture.  

These are best for:

- random thoughts
- web clippings
- meeting notes

Use 2 principles:

1. Make it frictionless to capture info
2. Process your fleeting files within 1 day

---
Reference files are where you house other people's ideas that are relevant to you:

- Books
- Tweets
- Podcasts

Use 2 principles:

1. Make them short
2. Write in your own words

---

Permanent files are where the magic happens.

As you write fleeting & reference notes, you'll spark original ideas:

- Write 1 original idea per file
- Link them to related files (via hyperlink or notation)
- Link them to the reference & fleeting notes that inspired them

---
Over time, you'll build a catalogue of original idea "building blocks" that are interconnected.

Luhmann was able to use these atomic  ideas in infinite variations to create long-form content.

Ex: 1 productivity idea can be linked to both art and economics in different contexts.
