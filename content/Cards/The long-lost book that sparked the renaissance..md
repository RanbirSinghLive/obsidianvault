- # Intro
	- **BOARD**: A king in court with his two princesses
	- Two **princesses** were born to a **king**. They stood a chance to rule the world one day. **The king's acolyte** put them in **disguise for their protection**. A new order conquered the **empire**. **Captors** took the disguised **princesses** to their **remote hideout** for **their own needs**. They **renewed their disguises** to **save themselves** from destruction. One day, an intrepid **knight** came up the hill to free them. But he did so for their **beauty**, not for their **royal pedigree**. His actions allowed them to **rule the world that was their birthright**.
	- **BOARD**: The written text of the 'true' story
	- This is a true story, only with false characters
	- True stories about people are the most compelling
	- But true stories about ideas have had a far greater impact on the world
	- **BOARD**: The written text is edited as per below
	- Let's rewrite the story with the actual characters
		- Two **ideas** were born to **Epicurus**. They stood a chance to rule the world one day. **Lucretius** put them in **a poem**. A new order conquered **antiquity**. **Monks** took the disguised **ideas** to their **monastery** for the **parchment they were written on**. They **were rewritten** to **be saved** from destruction. One day, an intrepid **book hunter** came up the hill to free them. But he did so for their **use of beautiful Latin**, not for their **content**. His actions allowed them to **enter the mainstream discourse for good**.
	- **BOARD**: The rewritten story becomes a timeline, sentence by sentence.
	- The true story spans 2000 years and the entire historical saga of the Western world.
- # Two Ideas were born to Epicurus
	- **BOARD:** Map of Greece with dots for ancient cities.
	- Our story begins in Ancient Greece
	- A loose collection of city-states where locals were experimenting with domains like literature, philosophy and science
	- On the island of Samos, a boy named Epicurus grows up. He's given an education typical of ancient Greece. He becomes versed in things like geometry and rhetoric.
	- **BOARD**: Map expands to the east to include Anatolia and the Levant
	- When Epicurus was a boy, Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont into Asia and shifted the mindset of Epicurus' generation to understand the greater world beyond Greece
	- **BOARD**: A chalkboard outlining Epicurus' key ideas
	- Atomism
		- Like his predecessor Democritus, Epicurus believed that the world was made up entirely of atoms and voids
		- He believed that this mix extended infinitely out into the universe
		- He believed that the motion of atoms was largely determined, but humans had the ability to change the trajectory of atoms through free will
		- So how should humans use that free will?
	- Humanism
		- Epicurus was a hedonist, but in the classical sense. Nowadays hedonism gets a bad wrap
		- He thought that pleasurable things were morally good and painful things were morally evil
		- Thus the purpose of life could be to do maximum good and minimum evil
		- The ultimate goal being a permanent state of chill, free from all pain and suffering
		- He believed that death was the end for humans. God was not central.
		- Therefore, humans shouldn't fear divine punishment, but strive to live a simple life, free from pain 
	- **BOARD**: A gravestone with the worbs being written
	- Many ancient gravestones contain the Epicurean epitaph: I was not; I was; I am not; I do not care
	- Unfortunately, very few of Epicurus' original works survived. His princesses needed a protector
- # Lucretius put them in a poem
	- **BOARD**: Shifting map from Greece to Rome
	- The power balance in the ancient world would eventually shift from Greece to Rome
	- The Romans came in contact with Greeks, adopted their customs and conquered them
	- The lineage of antiquity ideas remained unbroken
	- The protector of Epicurus' ideas ended up being Lucretius
	- Very little is known of his life, and his grand poem, On The Nature of Things, is his only surviving work
	- **BOARD**: Collage of archaeological artifacts
	- We know of the ancient world through rubble and fragments
	- Very little of Epicurus' original work survives
	- It took the synthesizing of his ideas into a 7,000-verse poem, to make it to us today
	- And what a poem...
	- It weaves together art and science
	- The famed philosopher Cicero called it "rich in brilliant genius, yet highly artistic"
	- It's written in 7,400 line hexameter - 6 beat lines that don't rhyme.
	- It is a hard book to penetrate, but hidden inside are the gems of Epicurus, strengthened through vivid imagery
	- **BOARD**: Botticelli's Venus
	- It opens with a hymn about Venus, the Roman goddess of love, beauty and prosperity:
		- Mother of Rome, delight of Gods and men,
		- Dear Venus that beneath the gliding stars
		- Makest to teem the many-voyaged main
		- And fruitful lands—for all of living things
		- Through thee alone are evermore conceived,
		- Through thee are risen to visit the great sun—
		- Before thee, Goddess, and thy coming on,
		- Flee stormy wind and massy cloud away,
		- For thee the daedal Earth bears scented flowers,
		- For thee waters of the unvexed deep
		- Smile, and the hollows of the serene sky
		- Glow with diffused radiance for thee!
	- One doesn't know why as the rest of the poem can be read as a refutation of the gods
	- How it mentions Atomism
		-  Epicurus's devoted follower, the Roman poet [Lucretius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius "Lucretius"), cites the gradual wearing down of rings from being worn, statues from being kissed, stones from being dripped on by water, and roads from being walked on in _On the Nature of Things_ as evidence for the existence of atoms as tiny, imperceptible particles.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStrodach201211-95)
	- How it mentions Humanism
	- Not all good
		- mention some outlandish claim in the book
	- For a secular work, it took a string of miracles for it to survive so long
- # Monks took the disguised **ideas** to their **monastery** for the parchment they were written on
	- The first miracle is the surviving the fall of Rome
	- In XXX, the city was sacked, it never regained it's splendor
	- The libraries of the Hellenistics decayed along with the books
	- But there was a new class of humans that needed books
	- Christianity brought with it monks
- # They were rewritten to be saved from destruction







- # Outline
	-	The book
		- How they started and evolved
		- What purpose they serve 
			- Knowledge transmission and preservation
	- Medieval Europe
		- Description
		- The Teeth of Time
		- The Monks
		- Then something changed...
	- The Renaissance
		- Renaissance literally means rebirth
			- of ideas from antiquity such as humanism - putting humans as more important than god
			- Previously known and then lost ideas
			- They survived centuries of war, decomposition and being considered blasphemy to come back to us
		- The Seeds of the Renaissance
			- We're used to big battles indicating the start and end of periods
			- For the Renaissance, this is the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans
			- But there's a problem, the Renaissance is not about any one kingdom, it's about ideas
			- And ideas don't live on the battlefield, they spread through speech
			- And books are codified speech from long ago
		- Book Hunters
			- In genetics, communities are insular, but 1 in X people travel far. The monasteries are the insular communities and book hunters take the ideas far
		- Meet Poggio
			- He has a unique career - book hunter
			- He's on the hunt for latin examples
			- but what he finds unleashes a force so powerful it undermines his faith
			- and we're still living with the ripples today, for better or worse
		- Poggio's Discovery
			- in 1417
			- Poggio just wanted a great example of latin, but he's unleashing something that'll undo his faith's dominance over his realm
		- callback to Venus in 1st line of poem - famous painting primavera by botticelli, made 60ish years after the poem was rediscovered
	- The Map of Knowledge
		- Show other ways in which ancient books were protected and revived
		- Islam protected knowledge via hubs in Baghdad and Cordoba
		- Re-entered the Catholic world through Toledo
	- Science Proves The Poet Right
		- Atomism
			- Heavily influenced Pierre Gassendi
			- Brownian Motion
				- State what actually happened
				- A remarkable description of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. Lucretius uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms
		- Erwin Mueller was the first person to visually see an atom
		- Now we have the 2018 pic of a strontium atom to refer to
	- Society Proves The Poet Right Too
		- Humanism
			- Influenced many in the build of Christian humanism
				- universal human dignity, freedom, and happiness
					- sourced from Jesus' teachings
			- Look at Index for Erasmus - talks of Epicurus
		- You need only look at the 'life, liberty and pursuit of happiness' of the US consitution to see the legacy
