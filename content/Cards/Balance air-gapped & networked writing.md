Air-gapped computers are disconnected from internet connections.

Air gaps are meant to protect systems from outside attacks.

Air-gapped writing & thinking occur outside of social media or a rapid feedback loop.

Examples include [[Journalling is time travel|journalling]] & [[This is my digital garden|digital gardens]].

Your brain is much more valuable than your computer.

When you write on social media, you're engaged in networked writing.

The benefits are growth & community.

The tradeoffs are mind viruses & lowest-common-denominator thought.

You need to balance air-gapped & networked writing to win.
