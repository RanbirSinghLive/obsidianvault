Since becoming a content coach, Iâ€™ve had to keep books for my solo business. This scared me initially.

But after some research, I realized how easy it is in most jurisdictions - Your own tax codeÂ **will**Â vary, but in principle, you need to keep the following:

1. A spreadsheet with sales & expense data
2. An estimation of your home office space
3. An income statement showing your P&L

As far as receipts are concerned, they're much easier to drudge up in the digital age on request. Just keep a separate email folder with all of them in case. Iâ€™ll link to theÂ [template](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/p9unqvx9ooc9h3godr7fqhmrmm933/z2hghnh3r5n8m3bp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXZhbG9uYWNjb3VudGluZy5jYS9ibG9nL2ZyZWUtYm9va2tlZXBpbmctdGVtcGxhdGU=)Â I used if youâ€™re based in Canada.

Don't let bookkeeping stop your solo business from taking off.
