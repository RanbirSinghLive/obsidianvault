In chess, the opening and endgame are played by the book. The middlegame is where uncharted complexity lies.

Similarly, work advice focuses on either getting hired or running the company. There is no focus on the 'messy middle.' Getting stuck in middle management without the skills to succeed is common. Little help caters to the pain points of struggling at the centre of business.

The term 'middle management' has become a punchline.

Chess theoryÂ neglects middlegames due to their complexity.

The opening follows a rehearsed 'line' that fractals out until a new move is made. Endgames involve a common piece array (_i.e. king & queen vs king & rook_). The advantaged side uses patterns to play these to a win.

Middlegame positions are unique in each game.

Memorization of 'lines' or patterns doesn't work. There are too many pieces on the board for the human mind to analyze. This is when chess most resembles the complex systems of a big business.

So what do chess players do in the middlegame?

They rely on evaluating their position based on a fluid list of priorities. Grandmaster & Psychologist Reuben Fine identified these as:

-   Keeping your king safe
    
-   Having more pieces than your opponent
    
-   Being more mobile
    

In middle management these can translate to:

-   Psychological safety
    
-   Skills
    
-   Adaptability
    

**The middle, in management & chess, is where we make advantages.**
