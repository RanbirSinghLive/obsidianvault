# Antisocial writers are bad writers

Writing comes from experience.

The act of writing is a solitary affair, but not the act of being a writer.

Hemingway, the archetypical writer lived a full live of big game hunting, war reporting & binge drinking in Paris.

You may think, ok, then you at least must think alone. The idea of the hermit thinker comes from christian times, not roman or greek.

[[The Swerve]] page 68.

The only act of writing alone comes after all that experience & debate. You rush to write it all out, but your well will run dry and then you must head out and live once again.
