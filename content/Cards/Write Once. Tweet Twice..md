Every morning, I engage with my fave creators & write 6-8 tweets.

All in 30-45 minutes.

With 1 simple method.

Write Once. Tweet Twice.

The Twitter User Evolution:

Consumer → Active Consumer → Creator

You need to live in stages 2 & 3.

Curate a list of creators.

Put creators you like on a Twitter List.

Consume only their content 90% of the time.

With the other 10%, discover new creators to grow your list.

Become an active reader

When a tweet resonates, don't keep it to yourself.

Write a smart comment.

Smart comments can be:

• related personal stories
• additional points
• clever jokes

Don't reword the top tweet & leave it at that.

Now, this is where it gets interesting.

Reword your comment as a top-level tweet.

You'll want to:

• add context
• refine your idea
• add an example
• say it differently, like a fun A/B test

Same idea. Said 2 ways.

Is this cheating? No

Twitter is just saying the same thing in 1000 different ways. 

Not all comments can become tweets.

But this method will:

1. make you write smart comments
2. which will make you a better engager
3. and then a better writer

Now here is the key.

Schedule your reworded tweet to publish 1 week later.

Why?

In a week, 99% of people will have forgotten the lesson.

They need to be reminded.

But don't stop here.

Think of a continuation tweet & write it.

This can be:
- a listicle
- a companion idea
- a related personal story

Schedule the continuation idea as soon as you want

The beauty of it: 

If you get a follower from the smart comment, they immediately get a similar message.

This process produces 1 comment & 2 tweets from every moment of inspiration.

It can easily produce all of your content at the beginning of your Twitter journey.

So to summarize:

1. Find a good tweet
2. Post a smart comment
3. Reword the comment into a top-level tweet
4. Schedule for next week
5. Write a companion tweet
6. Post immediately
7. Repeat
