# The Two Paths

Bad Twitter networking advice states to:

-   Ask for mutual follows
-   Send 100 generic DMs a week
-   DM an automated welcome message to new followers

If you’re only looking to pitch an offer, use this advice. But if you’re looking to make high-leverage, genuine connections, read on.

**Good Twitter networking advice states to ‘be a bro.’**

But these 3 words can be interpreted in 1,000 different ways.

In this guide, I’ll show you how I’ve turned them into a genuine method for making connections on Twitter.

# Where Networking Happens

Genuine Twitter networking happens on & off the platform:

-   Commenting
-   Quote retweeting
-   DMing
-   Emails
-   Zoom Calls
-   Meet-ups

But what’s more important is the How…

# How Networking Happens

Genuine Networking Occurs in 3 phases:

1.  Outreach
2.  Conversation
3.  Continuation

In More Details:

1.  Someone needs to initiate a dialogue
2.  The other person needs to accept the dialogue
3.  Either person initiates a second dialogue at a later time

It may seem simple, but thinking in first principles helps to get everyone on the same page.

Now onto the good stuff…

# 1 Can Beat 1000

Gaining more Twitter followers does not mean you’re building a better network.

It could mean exactly the opposite.

I’m perfectly happy to grow by 1 follower per day, if that follower is:

-   An active Twitter user
-   Receptive to my outreach
-   Genuinely interested in my content

It’s not unheard of to have 1,000 followers & only get two comments per tweet.

My biggest fans comment up to 3 times daily EACH (if I’m particularly on fire that day).

# Real Life Etiquette

Imagine Twitter is a house party you’re invited to, but your only friend left early.

You see a circle of strangers having a chat.

Firstly, do you care what they’re talking about?

If not, don’t speak.

If you do, you decide to step into the circle.

Someone says something interesting.

You have 3 options:

1.  Repeat what they’ve just said in different words
2.  Randomly make the conversation about yourself
3.  Keep the conversation going in a complimentary way.

There’s only 1 right answer, and you know which it is.

Imagine every comment starts with 2 invisible words:

“Yes, and…”

# Bring People In

As you’re engaging with people, try to bring others into the conversation.

1+1=3, but 1+1+1=30.

The more people you bring together, the more your reputation as a genuine networker grows.

Look at this exchange between Jordan, Conor & I:

# Remind Yourself

A follower told me he wanted to journal for a month.

I put a reminder into Todoist to check in on him in 30 days.

I followed through.

In total it took 2 minutes of my life.

But I’m sure he remembers it.

# Opportunities Are Unexpected

My biggest Twitter opportunity came when I applied to something completely different.

I applied to be a content creator at Hypefury.

An agency founder saw my comment, viewed my profile and reached out.

That founder is now my new boss!

# Reciprocate Systematically

I get busy.

I don’t always have time to engage with my network.

But I religiously respond to my mentions, eventually.

When I respond to my mentions, I click each commenter’s profile and show them some quick love back.

This way I’m nurturing relationships on autopilot.

Use engagement systems whenever you can.

# Ask For One Thing

When building relationships, pretend like you only have 1 coupon to ask them for something. You can use it whenever, but it gains more value the longer you wait.

You can ask them for a follow right away.

A week later, you can ask them to subscribe to your newsletter.

A month later, you can ask them to trial your product and leave a testimonial.

You can only ask for one thing.

Otherwise, you can only give.

# Take A Minute Longer

We all fall into the repetition game when we’re growing.

And we can get robotic with engagements.

But every now and then something really resonates with you.

When it does, take another minute on your response.

Write something that really conveys how much it affected you.

DM them even.

This is why you’re on this earth - to do meaningful things, not ensure you hit your 30 daily comments.

# The Value You Can Give Big Accounts

If you’re reading this guide you’re probably a small account.

And you’re probably networking with mostly small accounts.

You may also be engaging with big accounts and not getting much back.

But be honest, what can you give them?

Not likes, comments or DMs.

They're swimming in those.

‘What do you give the person who has everything?’

A fresh perspective.

That’s the best currency you carry. Telling them something they don’t already know.

And your chance will come.

Just keep being genuine.
