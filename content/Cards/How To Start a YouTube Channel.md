1. Get Going
2. Get Good
3. Get Smart

## Get Going:
- Make crappy videos, there's no way around it
- NIches don't matter at this point
- Easy videos: talk about a favourite thing of yours

## Choice 1:
1. Stop after ~20 videos
2. Casual Relationship - just for fun - can't expect growth
3. Serious Relationship - publish consistently - leads to Get Good

## Get Good:
- Done via quantity or quality
- Most people should start with quantity and this eventually, naturally leads to quality
- Quantity for Ali is 1-2 videos per week
- [[Parable of the Pottery Class]] (30 pots vs 1 pot in a month)
- Your skills will compound [[1% Better Each Day]]
- Able to make 'good' videos after video 80

	- Editing
	- Music
	- Sound Design
	- Writing
	- Structure
	- Branding

## Two Measures of Good:
- Intrinsic
	- If someone you know tells you they ran into your videos, how much would you cringe?
- Extrinsic
	- Are people clicking? - click thru rate
	- Are people watching? - watch time & retension
	- Engagement rate - comments
- Intrinsic matters most

## Choice 2:
1. Hobby
	1. Focused on yourself
2. Business
	1. Focused on others
- This is a spectrum, not a binary choice
- If you choose business, then you proceed to step 3

## Get Smart:
- To run your channel like a business, you need to prioritize what *your audience wants*
- The intersection of what you love, what your audience wants and what you can make money from - a la [[Ikigai]]
