Development: 2 Moderate

The mundane interactions in your day matter the most. Exciting travels & big accomplishments only make up 10% of your life. The other 90% is mundane day-to-day life.[^1]

Mundane things like how you:

- wake up
- talk to your partner
- commute to work 

*matter* & if you can optimize these things, the benefits will ripple throughout the rest of your life.
