Scenes:: [[On the eve of high school, Happy moves out of his childhood home due to a family fight.]]

This is Happy's old apartment when the family lived together. It is his childhood place that Minder and Jagpreet are living in.

It's where Minder took care of him as the closest thing to a real father figure he'll have.

It's the apartment he goes back to at the end of the novel to claim as his own home alongside Minder.
