I need to pay the city $5.5k each yearÂ forÂ the privilege of owning my home. We changed addresses last year (and updated it online) but our property tax bill still went to the old apartment. No one cared to forward it to us.

The only reason I found out: I felt a hunch it had been too long since I'd received a bill.

I went to the city's website and found our bill, accruing interest (up to $300 now).

I paid it immediately and set multiple reminders in my Todoist workflow to never miss it again.

If I'd been a bit more forgetful, I could've woken up one day to see my home listedÂ forÂ sale in the local newspaper:
