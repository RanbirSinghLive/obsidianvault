A Zettelkasten is a system of note taking that aims to create a back catalog of notes, written in your own words, that link to other notes in your catalog.

By creating a interlinked set of [[Atomic Notes]] , one can find connections between disparate ideas and make the subsequent work of writing articles or essays much easier.
