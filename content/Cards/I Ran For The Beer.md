[Man dead after shooting in Rexdale | CP24.com](https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/daylight-shooting-in-rexdale-leaves-1-man-dead-2-suspects-sought-1.6789458)

When he died, Hans texted us to see if we remembered him. His nickname was Ricky. His second nickname was Scarface for the two gruesome scars he had on each cheek from two separate knife fights.

He was my neighbour in childhood and he'd been shot two days prior in a stripmall. His younger brother and I used to be in a gang together.

I was friends with his brother and I there was a time I would've doe anything to become better friends. There was a time I'd cry with him, or get riled up and pretend I could do anything about it for him. But now I was 500 km away in Montreal. A different city, language and life. And I didn't call home, not even to say I was sorry. But why?
