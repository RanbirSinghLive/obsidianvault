The act of pretending fake events are real. Originates in professional wrestling.

People inside the industry know they're fake, but all pretend they're real when in view of the public.
Wiki:
In response to a request for suggestions of the single scientific concept with the greatest potential to enhance human understanding, [Eric Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Weinstein "Eric Weinstein") proposed the system of kayfabe:[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe#cite_note-30)

> If we are to take selection more seriously within humans, we may fairly ask what rigorous system would be capable of tying together an altered reality of layered falsehoods in which absolutely nothing can be assumed to be as it appears. Such a system, in continuous development for more than a century, is known to exist and now supports an intricate multi-billion dollar business empire of pure hokum. It is known to wrestling's insiders as "Kayfabe".
