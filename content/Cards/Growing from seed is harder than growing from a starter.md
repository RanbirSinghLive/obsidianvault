- if your goal is to produce, then it doesn't matter. Do whatever is easier
- if your end goal is testing your capacity as a gardener, then seeds are the way
- In digital gardens, its the same principle
- starting from a workable, borrowed idea will write you a great article, but your writing/thinking capacities aren't challenged as much
- Writing from a seed is a true test of drawing from the core of your being
- We'll start by saying no ideas are original, but some are more original than others.
- They come from the digested slurry of your gut vs the assembled dinner on your plate
- The differences are:
	- more complete scrambling
	- more effort & time to digest
	- less discernable in their origins
