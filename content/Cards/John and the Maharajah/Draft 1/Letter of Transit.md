I held the letter and hoped it wasn't bullshit.

The sick man's name had been Isaac Torbei. I burdened Antun's mother with his presence, but I only planned on it being for a few days. The wages of the Emir and spare work were enough for room, board, and a painfully slowly growing travel fund. Beirut was too firmly a Ottoman province that I had found no local decision makers to endear myself to. The satiation of civilization was too entrenched here for real adventure.

Isaac told me about his last expedition, travelling to Shiraz in search of treasure. He'd been taught all the languages of Europa by a rich benefactor who loved him beyond a brother. Then he'd decided to travel East for fortune with other Frenchmen. Initially it had been upon Napolean's takeover of Egypt that he had come and tried to help with government. Nelson's destruction of the French fleet and subsequent blockade had made it clear the adventure was doomed. Napolean had snuck away on a ship back of Egypt but the apparatus remained. Isaac had since been wandering the East and learning it's tongues. His last expedition had taken him on to get rich in Iran and had earned some money through illicit means. He admitted to annoying them with his drunken stupors, but he was blessed to never lose his words in spite of the drink. Once they'd reached back to the Mediterranean coast he was no longer of use and on their last nerve. Whether he'd been robbed on drunken the loot away was a question I would never have the answer to.

"I don't want to leave them alone," Antun said.

"You are skilled, and a worth student. But I am not stating here. I came to travel. You can learn with me on the road and earn a good salary to save up for them. When you come back you'll have money, but better yet you'll have the skills of a European doctor to earn a living. You've seen what I can do and what the Emir pays me. A pittance to me but a fortune to you," I said, catching my breath.

"All I've seen you do it trick and harass people into giving you money for health,"

'Well the first thing is, that's what any job is. Even if you're digging rocks in a quarry, you think you've come out ahead if you strike 90 blows with your axe instead of 100 for the same pay. And the second thing, I'm actually healing people. We saved that boy on the eve he was to catch his deathly illness. Our drunkard translator lives. And I hear your Bishop lives. You owe me for that one. I won't pass by the convent to collect my second half and you can consider it a donation if that'll convince you I'm not just a cold money troll," I said.

I knew I had him. Just in time as Isaac had returned riding in the back of a cart with some new robes on him and in a sack, all bought from the market.

"Go pack your things," I dismissed Antun.

"Will this work?" I waved the letter in his face.

"Sure it will. It got us here unmolested." A foul perfume of spirits wafted out of his mouth. 

A drunkard and a young man who hasn't left his village. I didn't feel like waiting around much longer so they would have to do until better help could be mustered.[^1]

"The sun is still rising for God's sake," I said.

"You pay me, I spend it how I want."

I inspected the local robes. My Western clothes would be a target going inland. There were nomadic bandits and agents of states hostile to whatever European country they'd pin us to. We needed to look Asiatic, from a distance at least. It was time to become an actor for a character I had not seen on stage yet. Our safe passage and possessions depended on it. 

We stepped into the curtained section of Antun's home to begin. We swapped our tight fitting clothes for the loose flowing robes of the Orient. Antun told us there was a shop on the coast that would give us some money for the European clothes as they may be able to sell replacements to the next batch of adventurers.

Antun would help us tie turbans a little outside of town to not burden ourselves quite yet. Instead of open flowing hair, I would have open-toed feet. We would sleep on mats instead of beds.

I would pay to link us up with a trading caravan heading East for Damascus so as to have strength in numbers. I would get my own camel and my sleeping mat would double as my saddle. My few spare pieces of clothing would sit in saddle-bags. My medical trunk and any treasure I could find would be carried by a single mule for myself, and a second one spared for the goods of Antun and Isaac.

"You came all the way back from Persia, and now you'll go back. I know it's our deal but I can't make a man do anything he doesn't want for too long or you'll run off or worse yet kill me. Why are you going?" I asked.

"I can't go home. There's no family or home left that'll have me. Here my currency is who I am to some people. What use is a Frenchman who can speak the language of the barbarian in Paris?"

For a second time since the storm on the Black Sea, I was rushedly divesting of precious goods. I had lost more than I'd gained so far in this Orient.

"Well then may be both find our glory further inland," I said.

"Whether it's glory or infamy we find, I'm commited."
