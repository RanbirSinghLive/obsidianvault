CHALLENGED BY TRYING TO SPEAK ARABIC PREMATURELY

REWRITE THAT THEY'RE HEADING TO HAJJ INSTEAD OF GOING HOME FROM IT.

We'd been on the run from the bedouins for the better part of a day. Hamza's spyglass had saved our lives and he wouldn’t stop reminding us of it. We’d trekked through the midday sun which had been our cooking through. We ran because we had no choice. That fucker Hamza had insisted we not procure any so we could pass as hajjees. Our robes lent us that illusion and mine and Isaacs skin tone might’ve only complicated matters in so far as we were allegedly from Bosnia. The overwhelming diversity of the Moslem faith allowed us to tell fables.

We had wanted to avoid men but 24 hours of forced marching with no solitary sight of men, beasts or even trees was its own lesser terror. 

A shiver ran through me in the heat somehow. We had not been permitted to light a fire, sing or even whistle to keep warm in the night.

A whisper stirred at the front of the caravan. It came every few hours down the line of men as a variation of a warning to keep silenced discipline. I waited to hear what Occidental curse Anrin employed to translate this quip. We’d already been through the gamut.

“There are tents ahead. We are in sight so it is too late to go around without drawing suspicion,” Antun whispered.

“Well in that case we can stop whispering with birds," I retorted.

We approached the den. It was tents between some low hills. 

The first one to come out of the tents to see us as we passed by closely was a woman. There was silence and no acknowledgement from Hamza and his helpers. I assumed they were waiting for a man to come out.

“Selam Alekim,” Antun called proudly, not as mannered as them apparently.

"Walekim Selam," the woman called back in a hoarse milling of a voice. More figures emerged from the tents. More women.

They were *only* women.

"Where are you going?" the hoarse women rasped.

NAME was silent and caught up.

"We're hajjees going home," Antun chimed in.

"Ah, and how is Mecca? Medina?" the woman said.

"It is hard to describe in words," Antun said, after a pause.

"Why is your friend so pale? And the other one too? Long journey?" the woman pointed at Isaac and myself.

"They are pashtuns from the East headed home. I'm Waziri," Antun said.

"Well you must stay to eat while our husbands get home," she said.

The men looked at each other. It was in their best interest to leave, but speeding off in the face of hospitality was unwise.

"We can stay for tea, but we must be going before dark," NAME said.

"Well we'll see how long that takes," she said.

I realized we'd dodged a bad roll if she'd told use the men were coming back soon. So far the subtext was they were still a few hours out. Good news.

"The pashtuns will dine with me," she said.

I dismounted and went about helping the men make lunch. They insisted on making their own food to offset the risk of poisoning. We would have to take our chances with the tea however. We made rice with butter and ate dried dates as our side dish. The dates were pleasantly sweet but left me wanted more tea. I was at last seated with the head woman and her chaperones. Isaac was beside me in withdrawal.

"What's wrong with him?" she asked.

"He may be at the beginning of ill," I said, quite honestly, but not revealing the cause of course.

"Long trips can be deadly. He doesn't look like he belongs in the sand yet thankfully," she said.

"How do you mean? I don't think he's dying," I said, reminding myself not to be too clinical.

"Here we form a grave and heat it with fire. We then put the man insdie and cover him. Afterwards he eithers gets better or dies, both of which happen with haste. If he dies we simply fill in the rest of the grave. The wounds are usually from spear of sword. If he gets better, he must immediately take his mount and go to the next battle," she said, sipping her tea.

"That's quite radical," I said.

"Your Arabic is childish," she said, offering me a liberal portion of her black dried meat, which I took happily as Isaac shot me a look. I didn't not what kind of meat it was but it was edible without any foul taste, a blessing.

"Not my first language. I know enough to say prayers but I learn more before Hajj," I said.[^1]

"Do you have any wine?" Isaac said.

"Aye," I snapped.

"Hajjis asking for wine. I know you're on your way home by my god," she said.

"Sorry for him," I said.

"Drinking, white-skinned hajjis. The desert hasn't seen your kind," she said.

NAME showed up behind us from his own gathering of men. The rest of the men had sat on their own, our host being the most confident in our company while the other men had received tea from women who'd shuffled off.

"Thanks for your hospitality, we must go to keep the sun," NAME said.

"But I have so many questions. Your camels are quite heavily laden for pilgrims," she said.

"Thanks for your hospitality," NAME said firmly.

We loaded our camels in a hurry and started moving. It was then that I realized we were travelling in the direction we had come from.

I sent a message up the chain.

"Ask NAME why the bloody hell we're travelling towards the men of these witches?" I said.

The answer came back down the line from NAME himself, who didn't trust the chain.

"They need to think we're going the wrong way so they can tell their husbands our direction. As soon as they're gone on the horizon we will turn south and wide around them. Let's pray we succeed. If they run into us they'll know us to be a farce once we're searched and they find your coins. Then they'll kill us if we're lucky or leave us on the dunes if we're not," NAME said.

"In that case, we should ride all night again," I said.[^2]



[^1]: make his language choppier in this scene as he's out of his element. Isaac helps him out.
[^2]: Ironic as he'd complained about all night riding at the beginning of the chapter.
