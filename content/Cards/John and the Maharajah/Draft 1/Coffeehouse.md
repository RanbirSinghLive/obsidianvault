The sun didn't do the trick. We arrived in port in Constantinople a chattering mass. My heart was warmed only for a moment upon our sail down the Bosphorus. The fishing villages increasing in frequency until they culminated in the timeless city to the right, perched on the Golden Horn. The glory of Byzantium on the Western bank, contrasted with the naked, bare potential of the East across the strait, with countless ferries and. barges between them like candles on strings.

The boat docked north of the Horn in Galata. It was off to be refitted once it was rid of us, and the crew felt that should be immediately. Us being the most pertinent reminder of the cargo they'd lost in exchange for us, the cargo worth less but more troublesome to have thrown overboard. The Greek captain, renewed from his cabin withdrawal, spit onto the ship's decks as I walked the gang plank off of it. We were checked out by a pilot who didn't think we were contagious enough to impose a quarantina, which was all the rage now that Napolean was doing it. The French woman was whisked away by her husbands men while the good were getting unloaded. I lingered, unsure of what to do with no real belongings to speak of. The arnauts were done getting what remained of their belonging and heading out in formation. The soldier-boy beckoned me to come with them. I happily obliged. 

We arrived at a coffeehouse. It was not the sultan's for sure. It was barely four walls and catered to a more working sort instead of a ruling sort. The smell of grilled meat wafted in and out through the curtained exterior walls. The wind wafted with it, making it a slim reprieve from the chill, and accelerating the chill within him and the rest of his new platoon. He looked out of place with them, with their red hats and white tunics and him in his travel suit. He looked to be a man of ledgers and them a mercenary band. I luckily had enough money in his waist to pay my own way, already owning the arnauts for not leaving me to the pickpockets at the docks. The coin I paid to enter was amongst the dozen I still held. My purse would lighten quickly in this expensive city without my tools to replenish it. And if I didn't shake me chill my efforts would be spent on healing myself, which while vital was less lucrative than healing others.

In the centre of the cofeehouse, a coal fire burned. The mass of arnauts quickly slipped off their wet boots and pushed existing patrons to the side with little resistance. They saw on their butts and pointed the soles of their feet to the fire. At first they kept a safe distance from the flames, but as the extent of their numbness became apparent they scooted closer until some of their feet were being licked by flame, a sizzling of humans now mingling with the grilled meat smell.

"You have to get foot feet back," I said. No one listened. I grabbed the soldier-boy first because I knew he wouldn't strike me. I grabbed him by the shoulders and tried to pull him backwards. He was half my size but immoveable, and simply gestured for me to join them. I stepped in between him and the tall brute to his left and stood with the tip of my coat real close to the flames and my face facing outwards into the circle of Albanians yelling at them to move themselves away from the fire.

"You. You need to be quiet," called the coffeebar's enforcer from the door.

"These men are going to burn off their skin and get mortification. You need to help me save them," I said.

"If they were being burned I'd hear them screaming, but they're not and you are. I won't return your coin if I have to kick you out," he said.

The overall heat of the cofeehouse was getting to me. It was a treat but deathly to switch too quickly from cool to hot and I would die with these men. 

"Leave them for a moment and come here," called a different man in an ostenatious turban sitting on a padded cushion near a curtain. The accent on his Turkish was unmistakably Scottish. I'd found a real European. He waved off the doorman, but it seemed to be a favour instead of a command.

I stepped over the Albanians and went to him.[^2] His turban was of course bigger up close. It sat atop a head with more forehead than chin and a groomed mustache with sharp points on either tip.

"Alexander Burnes, dear fellow," said the man.

"Johann Martin Honigberger," I replied.

"Well you know I'm Scottish, but I'm not the best at spotting you Eastern Continentals. I'm much better at pinpointing Mohammedan shahs curiously," said Burnes.

"I'm Transylvanian," I explained.

"There it is, I had no hope on that one," Burnes said. The man was barely one, ten years my junior.

"Are you here to study at the new university?" I asked.

Burnes detected my attempt at belittlement and bristled.

"I've been serving in the Company since I was 16 old man," Burnes said.

"What are you doing in these parts?" Burnes said.

"You sound as if you're starting at the entrance of a banquet," I said.

"This is a great dance beyond me in Asia. Any His Majesty may not like it if I took advantage of any leverage to find out if the new non-Brit entering the game was an agent of an enamy state or simply a solider of fortune," Burnes said.

This let me upturn a smile propelled by a holstered revelation.

"Neither," I said.

"Well, then you really must tell me."

"Well I'm more that latter but I'm selling my sword. I'm selling my hands to heal," I said.

"Well them, you may end up richer than us all. What's youre destination?" Burnes said.

"Whoever will pay the highest," I said.

"I think your criteria should be more multifacted than that. High pay can come from a tyrant. In the Orient, tyrants aren't even nominally beholden to Habeas Corpus. I've seen men paid and then fined in one round transaction," Burnes said.

"So what do you suggest?" 

"Well there are a few upright rulers I've visited upon, But none beat Ranjit Singh of the Punjab. He's in the market for European solders but also doctors due to a lifetime of ailments. He'll pay top rupee for men who can tear people apart and put them back together," Burnes said.

I was skeptical

"The Punjab? How long until your forces subdue them," I asked.

"We're not the baddies. They're great allies and I hope his Majesty doesn't feel the need to jackboot them," Burnes replied.

I took a look over my solider at the satiated soldier-boy and his blackening toes. We would be dead in two weeks, maybe less.
