We arrived in Hit close to a week later, on our last food and water. The skin on my forearms was browned and wrinkled from the sun.

We found an inn that would take us. I was in need to making money so I looked for work as a doctor. 

I must tell of who I am to make money here. 

They hope to get some respite but are caught up in the attack of the Ageli's against the Agha, who is thought to be killed.
