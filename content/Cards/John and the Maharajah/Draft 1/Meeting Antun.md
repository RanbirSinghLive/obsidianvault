The sail from Constantinople to Beyrout was much smoother. I even afforded an interior berth shared with a textile merchant who was travelling to acquire rights to the region. I spent most of the time applying and reapplying the Lawsonia inermis to my feet from toe to heel. The mud had seemingly permanently died my feet a fruitish orange. The colour I judged to be purely cosmetic and hoped it would come off once the herb had worked it's magic completely. My feet had begun to feel better soon after sailing, which could be attributed partly to the herb and partly to the change of air. There was nothing toxic about the capital of the turks nevessarily, but changing to a new air often helped ailments to those who could afford the means. And now I could afford the means thanks for a week-odd at the Bazaar healing odd ailments with Kasim's pantry. The feverish man's tapeworm had been 52 yards long at final count, enough of a theatric to bring more customers and convince Kasim to get in line. Normally I would've given the man a detectant before making him vomit, but desperate times were upon me and I waas lucky and blessed. I believe that the worms are contracted by breathing air contaminated with decomposing substances and mulberry leaves which the silkworms eat. The textiles being woven nearby at the culprit for sure.

Most of my patients had been genuine but when hyterics came into play with women, even a sugar tonic could help sooth their tempers and benefit their households, even if not real ailment was present.

I had been hired by the Emir of Mount Lebanon province who had heard of me in the Bazaar. He paid for my transport and a place to sleep once I got to Beirut. I had earned enough to pay for a new medical kit that could cure most ailments I'd learned to cure in Europe, but also some Oriental ones I'd asked Kasim to reconnoitre for me once our mutual trust had developed over profits. 

The arrival in Constantinople had been one of a minnow meeting it's flock at a festival. In Beyrout, we were one of a half dozen boats, in no real hurry to disembark and get going. The sense of time here was muted. The weather was just the hint of hospitability put on by coastal waters, with the forbiding of jagged mountains and endless desert behind it.

The boat docked and I was first off of it onto the pier. The only European in Western dress, I went to the porter boys standing awaiting. I had made sure my socks were pulled high and tight just before disembarking, so no one saw my jester feet. One of the porters would be for me. They were silent as I declared myself in Turkish. I figured it was more useful than German, English, or French in these parts.

"Sir, I am to be your helper," said the young man, in French actually.

He has a wide nosebrim with satiated eyes above it. A mustache that was fuller at the corners of his lips than the middle sat above his subdued smile.

"I was told there would be a welcoming party," I said.

"I am the party. Party of one," he said. His French was rudimentary but good enough to get along, thank God. I extended him towards my medical trunk which he picked up quickly.

He wore the traditional Oriental flowing pants and shirt. They were looser than the Turkish garb. Clothes must've gotten tighter the Western you went. I wondered if this may explain some difference in physiology.

"So you're a physician? We only have barbers here," Antun said.

"Yes I'm aware. That's why the Emir paid me to come here. I'm sorely needed he said."

"Barbers stay local but physicians seem to like travelling. You must have seen so many places. They brought a few physicians from Italy to Upper Egypt to deal with the plague two years ago," Antun said.

"Yes and I'm sure they saved many lives," I said.

"Actually them and their entire expedition were massacred," Antun said.

There was silence for a while as we may our way into the town from the dock.
 
"Take me to my quarters, I need to rest. And tell me how to find you later," I commanded.

"You won't need to find me, you're staying with my family," Antun said.

Antun brought them to a shack a few rows into a huddle of houses. The shacks were made of mud with a straw roof and an opening in the wall for the door with a shawl closing it for privacy. His mother and two sisters sat in the other room.

"You don't conceal your women," I said.

"We are Christian," whispered Antun.

That surprised me.

He pointed to my blanket on the ground and gently put down my medical chest.

"Sir, can I ask when to be paid ahead of your wages," he said.

"I'm supposed to pay you?" I said.

"Yes, I get a sense the Emir may have been distracted you when both spoke," he said.

I steped out to gather myself. I saw a dog scurrying away from the sun in the west. I was marginally better off than that dog at least.
