"I'll pay you half of that," I barked at the man holding the dried leaves in his hand like a baby bird. His billowy white shirt tucked into paints with a fez hat on top (too stereotypical)

The Grand Bazaar was quite possibly the oldest in existance. An indoor labyrinth with high white arches and ceilings that juxatposed the colourful slurry of goods and people beneath it. The nobleness of heaven compared to the cutthroat dealings occuring under the divine's watch.

I was on the hunt for one Lawsonia inermis, a herd reccommend by my new acquaintance Burnes from Scotland. It was from the East and prominent in the Punjab where he recommended I travel. He told me the herd was customary in weddings for it's healing properties for the good health of the applicant. I was to crush the powder and mix water make into a slurry for application.[^1]

The merchant was asking for 20 paras for a pittance of herb.

"Please, that's all I own. Have mercy on your brother of the book," I said.

"This herb has travelled from over the Himilayas and can fetch a pretty penny in the courts of the Germans. I cannot let go of it for anything else." He correctly sensed my desperation and was well calculated to let me suffer on feet and then knobs rather than let the herb be of use.

"I need time to think brother," I aid.

I turned my back to him and sat on his perch outward-facing the bazaar. It was a ruse to rest my feet. If I gave him my last penny I would be forced to lay at the feet of the local cardinal promising payment from my wife's father if they carted me home in bond. 

The crowd was swelling as the daylight hours came into full effect. I had nodded off in Burnes booth while he finished his smoke and he'd been a gentleman enough to let me reset for a new day.

I looked up at the plastered heaven for a sign. Then god's will tripped over my feet. It was on the form of a man near my age. Normally the tripping would've been recoverable but this man was of weak constitution so he fell right over.

"How are you man?" I asked in Turkish.

"I'm sorry," said the man responded in Greek, through trembling teeth.

I reconfigured my language pathways accordingly.

The man put his hands down behind him to try and get up but he was belaboured. 

"Are you feverish?"

The man looked taken aback in privacy. He looked like someone who was comfortable ensickened in private but now felt exposed.

"Yes... what do you want?"

Now that I had his gaze, the whites of his eyes were yellowed far past the norm,

"I'm a physcian. Do you have an appetite?"

"No not at all. What's that word?"

"I'm a barber, but more skilled. How long have you fevered?"

"Weeks, but it comes every single day, and the next I'm not so bad. Today is the worst."

"I know what's wrong with you. It's serious and needs tending to right now," I said.

I left the man to consider my offer. I turned to the merchant, how fully watching the situation.

"Brother, how much for some mustard seeds ground into some water," I said.

The merchant saw the eyes of onlookers on him and calculated that extortion may lead to a mob with this new attention.

"1 paras"

"Right away," I ordered.

"Why? What is it for?"

"It's a tonic. The 1 paras for the tonic and an additional 25 for my fees and you'll be better very quickly."

"How can i trust you?"

"I already bought your tonic on faith, but my services are less faithful,"

"Fine," he said.

I started patting the inside of his pocket.

"Is this your purse? I'll pull it out and count in front of your eyes. Hey brother, be my witness," I said, pointing to an older caned man who was watching.

The man had about 50 on him so I felt comforted I wasn't taking all his posessions. They would be useless to him without care anyways.

The merchant came from around the stall with a clay cup filled with the mustard water.

"Drink this wholly"

The man did and clutched his insides. He started vomiting

"What the heck," the merchant cursed.

"What have you done to me" the man screamed in between expulsions. The crowd started murmurring. 

The man had vomited up the liquid as well as foodstuffs from earlier in the day. Now he vomited up from deeper in his belly as hoped. A long string of saliva came up and hit the floor while not disconnecting at his mouth once he was done. He started fussing with it.

I grabbed his wet chin and turned his face towards me.

"Don't tear it or bite it. Keep your mouth open, we need to get it all out," 

The man nodded in submission at my healthcraft.

The next convulsion brought more of it up.

The crowd was frenzied.

"It's a tapeworm!" I shouted at them, switching to Turkish, to hedge against imaginations.

"This man was infested with a tapeworm, hosted in his belly and leeching off him for weeks, maybe months. Now it'll all be expelled and he'll be cured. I am a highly skilled physician from the court of the Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand. I am a friend of the Turks and your peoples. I can cure any ailment for a cheap fee. Tell your sick and injured that I am at the Bazaar under the tent of my new friend Brother Kasim,"

I fished four paras from my fee and extended them to the merchant.

"Give me another dose, that'll get the rest out The extra is your cut of our first patient," I said.
