CHANGE THIS SCENE TO OCCUR IN BEIRUT. THERE ARE TOO MANY SETTING CHANGES HERE.

HE'S HOPING FOR ALL THE MONEY UP FRONT, BUT THEY WILL ONLY GIVE HIM HALF AS THE OTHER HALF IS FOR WHEN THE MAN GETS BETTER.

The trek up the to the Wadi was perilous. Antun had been in a panic when he'd rushed home from church. He had implored me to travel to Kanobbin where his patriarch lay dying. As a man of science I looked down on Antun's relgiosity baseline, but understood he didn't know any better. I also knew many Catholics from Konstadt who were far past his zealotry. It helped that Maronites were just an ethnic cult, and believed the same things as Catholics, it helped me understand him better.

EXPLAIN MARONITES.

The convent is situating on a descending slope overlooking a stunning view of the valley than no doubt reinstated the Maronite's belief in the divine if they were lucky to visit.

My copy of the Dictionnaire Encyclopedique Francaise called this place a town, when it was in fact just a single convent.

Two men of the flock came to greet out our cart.

"You are the doctors for Bishop Mootran Seman?"

"I'm the doctor. He's my apprentice," I said, to which Antun perked his ears.

"How much will you charge to heal him?"

"That's rather abrupt is it not? I've come here on the good will of my apprentice, not to make a killing. I'll ask for a fair wage when we're done," I said.[^1]

I wasn't proud of my days in the Bazaar, but I was much less desperate now. The Emir has come through on his promise of an honest wage at least. And these people would surely pay for my way here and back, and it gave me an excuse to venture to a remote locale unmolested, which is why I was in the East after all. The justifications we tell ourselves alone.

"You have to negotiate a rate with them before you treat him," Antun said embarrassedly.

"What kind of commerce is that, your Bishop lie wanting and you would delay my assistance?" I said.

"Is it the custom here," said Antun, as I was brushing past the so-called men of God.

We got into the chambers of the Bishop, which smelled of bad air. His relatives and congregations were flooding the room like he was a King on his last breath. The man was rather waify to begin with but his unending fever had made him bone skinny and delirious. He looked near death.

"I'm not sure there's much I can do for this man," I said.

"We're aware of his fate. But you are her not and have your tools," the Bishop's brother said in good French.

"Alright. Pay me 2 kurus. 1 now for my materials and 1 after he has recovered, god willing," I offered.

To my surprise they pulled out a parchment and had prewritten a contract on it. They filled in my name and fees on it. It was one of a few pre-written. I wondered if they'd had anyone try already since I'd come. How many doctors had failed? 

Upon my signing most of the flock left the room on my instruction so I could get to work.

I lifted his sheets and saw countless leech marks.

"Merde," I said.

"What's wrong?" Antun said.

"They've bled this man to an inch of his life. What medicines have the given him" I said.

"They've given him a boiled root essence meant to be a laxative," Antun said after conferring with two parties.

"So he's out of blood and water," I said.

"He was constipated. That was the reason we gave him the laxative. It was four days. He went delirious then, not after," said his brother.

I treated him with an enema, which relieved his constipation right away onto a spare sheet.

"Now air out this bloody room, it smells of the death he's fighting," I said.

I held his face in my hands and dabbed it with a gentle mixture of vinegar and rose-water. I told Antun to rub his feet together to warm them.

I turned him on his side and exposed the back of his neck, where I applied a blister. I then gave him some opiate in powdered form for the pain. I put it in his mouth, then I made him gulp some water to rinse the tongue.

The Bishop began sweating and praying soon after. When I left the room he had quieted to a calm. I left Antun to pray for his recovery without me.

The bishop's brother wasn't done with me yet.

"We have another patient here, but his situation is different"

"How do you mean?"

He is French. He found him drunk in the street and put him up in bed. That was our mistake as he was penniless and hasn't been able to get up and leave since. If you cure him I doubt he'll pay you, but I would be in your debt.

"Take me to him," I said.

He was lying in a bed in a different wing of the convent. He wore clothes similar to me with a wide lapel and bright white hair made shinier by a perpetual sweat. His matching mustache was style to perk up on both ends by a couple of inches. The bristle hair still perked up in his current state.

He wheezed for air through a semi-blocked nose. I knew that meant it hurt to breath through the mouth. 

"He can't move any limbs. We can't move him his legs or one arm."

"Which arm,"

"His left"

"Then let's hope he's left-handed. Bring me a quill and parchment."

As the brother walked off, I went to the man, caught his tired eye and nodded my head before beginning to touch him. I worked my way over his limbs and noticed the stiffness like dead wood. I felt his neck and felt something the something the size of a stone and soft. I locked eyes and opened my mouth like a fish. He tried to mimick but gave up as the gentlest parting of his lips, shaking his head no. He was no doubt suffering from an angina.

I held up the parchment to him and put the dipped quill

I tried French first. "Can you understand me"

He wheezed louder which I assumed to be an affirmative.

"Now, draw a circle if you want to say oui, and a x if you want to say non. Do you want to get better?"

He drew a circle.

"Good. If I search you thoroughly, will I find find any money?"

He drew an X.

"A conundrum. You may tell me you're rich but if it's not here it's of no use to me you see. Do you have anything to trade? I am a man of adventure. I look towards going further East. You were party of a party before they abandoned you in your drink. I imagine they robbed you as well. Do you have any maps or letters of transit?"

He started writing very carefully. It became clear he was not left-handed, and I pressed the back of my journal into the parchment to give him some leverage for his shaky wrist. Drops of ink fell on his chest like black rain.

When he was done I looked at the paper.

*Langues*

"How many languages do you speak?"

"10"

"Which ones would be use East of here?"

*Arab. Persian.*

"Write me some Persian script. Any words."

The scrawls were wobbly but convincing.

"Alright, I will cure you in exchange for lessons. Ongoing payment will be made if you're good that you can spend on the win or arak of your choice," I offered.

The sick man drew circle once and then over again many times until the quill went dry. I took it out of his hand and set the writing instruments aside. I bend down towards my medical trunk and pulled out my longest needle, but kept it hidden from his view.

"Open your mouth wide," I said.

The man's lips parted pathetically again.

"Wider you drunkard," I said.

He wailed as I jutted the side of my palm into his chin to force the issue. The opening of his mouth emitted the stench of rotting mulch. I saw the top of the absess the back of his throat, blocking his breathing and feeding. In one smooth movement I lifted the needle and slid it in between his rows of stained teeth.

"Don't bite."

The needle pierced the absess and the man began gargling on the spilling blood immediately. A great sign.

I withdrew the needle and gave him control of his facilities again. The gargling began to turn into chocking. He wasn't ready to gulp again, and probably best he didn't. I turned him to his side and pushed his waste bucket close to his face.

"Try and spit," I said.

The man was able to. I felt the loosening of his limbs almost immediately. His wheezing turned to coughing and then normalized breathing that resembled relieving sighs. I patted his back. He found the strength in his neck to turn and look at me once more, his lips forming the words of a renewed man.

"Who the fuck trained you?"

[^1]: Shows contradictory nature from the Bazaar, but he is less desperate now.
