My passage through saṅsāra began on the Black Sea. I awoke when a weighty lurch port slid me off my bench. This drops of storm water exploded on the back of my neck before tricking down to the deckboards and finding their way through the gaps in the tar binding. My knees had done their part to break my fall but could keep the blunt pain to themselves no longer. I put hands down in the damp darkness and lifted myself up. I deduced that the cries from the crewmen around me were in Turkish and I luckily I'd learned enough to grasp their meaning. Across from me, the striking French lady from Jassy[^2] sat clutching her oversized reticule. The column of Arnauts around us were scrambling to be useful. In the night's dark the crimson caps and vermillion boots of each soldier blended in with the next in line to pretend an serpent. I tried to stand and wide-stepped into the lap of the arnaut still seated next to my spot and he yelled something back Albanian.

He understood the word for sorry in Turkish, luckily.

The relative lull in the storm revved back up to a gale and shower from the North straight into my face. The storm must have come in abruptly as the sails hadn't been drawn down in time. They had been ripped to shreds, with fragments left flapping on the closest mooring like a dozen flags of surrender to Poseidon. When I had boarded, he'd noted that the ship had no names yet two captains.[^1] The greek captain was CLOTHING and flailing his armas about. The Turkish one was CLOTHING and doing his best to ignore him with looking at the waves and appearing much paler.

A wave came over top of us. I gripped a lifeline slung across the deck of the open vessel and tried to steady myself. My neighbouring soldier was barely a man, his uniform no doubt repurposed from an older, deader Arnaut before him. He was about to vomit and turned over to do it off the edge of the boat as his manners were instincutal. The wave came behind him and almost took him over. I grabbed the waist of his army pants and pulled him counter to the wave.

"Thank you," he gasped once seated again.

"Next time just puke onto the deck. We're all friends here," I said.

The north wind meant the closest land was to the west but I saw nothing in the dark. I kept my eyes trained trying to adjust to night vision. A crack of lightning didn't reveal land, just the bobbing and listing of sister ships, some in better health than us, but all of them sailing dangerously low due to their bellies full of cargo.

We must've been no different.

I looked back to the North just in time to see the foam crest on a giant wave overtake the deck. I sucked in the better part of a breath as the water hit me like a dive. It would've sent be backwards but it reached it zenith and fell back itself, simply sending me to my knees again. As I wiped my face with the hand not gripping the lifeline, I felt compelled to count the arnauts but came up short in my recollection. The oldest only looked a few years senior to my shipmate. A shiver came over me now that the water had seeped all the way to my core through my overcoat, jacket and undergarments.

A crack. Shouting from the soldier boy and then a hair dipping into my scalp and pulling me to the right. The boat took a thud unless the recent ones but I had to see who was trying to rough me up first. The solder-boy let go of me with an intense expression. When he no doubt saw the anger in mine he motioned me to look behind me. When I did I saw the main mast of the ship, already broken and on it's side, tip over the he starboard side like a pen into ink.

The boat started bobbed intensely now that it was listless with no way to harness the gale and only be victim to it. Why had I chosen to ride on an open-top boat in such haste? Why was I in a hurry to embark on this foolish journey? A day's sail from Varna to Constantinople was shaping up to become an eternity in between. We were now powerless to disallow the storm water from lapping up over the sides and turn the ship into a wading pool. The beautiful lady kicked her heeled feet up and tucked them under her dress. This threw her centre of gravity and compelled her to lean back with her head over the top. This made her reconsider and she splashed her feet back into the pooling water.

The arnauts saw a window to be helpful and snapped to created two lines from the centre of the boat's deck to the port edge. Buckets were dunked in the centre and then passed along the lines before being emptied and their contents returned from whence they came. I saw the futility of this immediately as more water was coming in than these men could return. They had underused capacity in their machine. They needed to find more bucket equivalents and bail out more at a time. I didn't think heading over to direct them would end well. The few sailors around were busy trying to retie enough spare sail to the remaining smaller masts, but the cloth was drenched and there was little mast surface to work with in the dark.

Eager to help, I intercepted a floating suitcase near mine own, and unclasped it to send the packed clothes into the water of the deck. I half-listend out for protest from the owner but did't hear any, maybe they were on the other side of the boat now. I decided to put the soldier-boy's Turkish comprehension to the test. On cue he snapped to and grabbed the other side of the empty suitcase and he dunked it onto the water and lifted it over the edge. After a few minutes of using a spoon to hold back a ladel I noticed the water had reached my knees. 

We were losing.

I let out a wail of despair and let go of my handle, splattering water at both our waists. The boy surprised me when he pushed a leg through the water and grabbed by shoulder.

"Courage, we'll be OK," he said. 

I stared back at him, dazed, but no longer wailing. New motion from around me signalled that others agreed it was time to do something different. On the poop deck, two sailors grabbed the large earthenware oven that had heated the crews soup in harbour and threw it overboard. The turkish captain was upon me and my soldier-boy.

"Go to the bow, we're lightening the load," said the Turkish captain.

I grabbed my satchel from under the bench it'd been wedged into and held it under one arm as I started wading while holding a lifeline with the free hand.

"Leave that you idiot," shouted the captain as he easily passed me.

I gripped the satchel tighter and luckily he lost interest.

So we all half-swam to the back as the lady kept cowering and the arnauts kept bailing. My foot slipped on a plank, probably extra-slicken with an oil and I feel to my waist in the water. A moment of calm came over me in a brief break from my labour so I looked over to the side. I could no longer see any of our sister-ships on the waves. 

Once at the bow end of the ship, the joint captains beckoned their respective crewmen in their respective languages to start breaking the securings on the stacked cargo holds. Barrels of honey and bags of walnuts were chucked overboard as Turkish and Greek cries criss-crossed the open air deck. The waves were incessant and often returned the things we'd just thrown away.

The lionshare of our payload were large oxhides filled with tallow bound for Asia. They each weighted a virtual ton and were immoveable even with mine and the soldierboy's combined strength. The greek captain came to join us and it didn't work either. Frustrated, the Greek captain unsheathed his long, thin yatagan from it's simple scabbard and started hacked away at the tallow to convert the ox hide into smaller chunks. He got a dozen good strikes in before his yatagan broke in two, the loose end becomes stuck in the tallow. He threw the other end into the sea in disgust and looked around with vengeance for other things to throw. By the light of the newly visible moon, he saw my satcheul tucked between my legs.

"Give me that," he said.

"I'm a doctor. They're my instruments. We may need them," I pleaded.

The green captain went for my legs. I instinctively squeezed my shins together, but it only made me easier to tip over as he pulled the bag out with ease. I went falling into the tallow. When I opened my eyes, my head was only a short foot away from the blade sticking out. When I looked back my satchel was gone and the captain was wrestling with the soldier-boy.

The Turkish captain came to break them up. He held the boy in one grip.

"Leave him alone. You man threw away a doctor's instruments, which effectively means you threw away my livelihood," I said.

"In that case I should've thrown you in with it, we'd be lighter still," said the Greek captain.

The solider-boy lined up a punch across the hose of the Greek captain that ruptured it. 

"Stop," I said.

I tried to check on the Greek captain but he pushed me away.

"Fine, let's all drown," he said as he plunged into the water and swam back to the captains cabin under the poop deck.

I was surprised to be able to see the man all along the path and then I noticed the moon to be even more visible than before. I looked up to see the clouds breaking in the direction our misery was coming from.

"The storm is breaking," I shouted at the soldier-boy.

The word was already spreading amongst the crew as they shifted back from shedding cargo to bailing water, refactoring so as to not lose any more commerce.

The storm left rather suddenly. I stopped in assistance with the bailing once the water was at my shins again due to exhaustion. The was a mistake as my idleness brought on the shivering. I was able to step back towards my old berth to see if any of my items had escaped my bag and ended up remaining onboard. My documents and money was packed against my chest so likely remained in some semblance of intactness. I would note venture for them until the outside of my coat was dry.

I came upon the French lady again, wringing out the bottom of her dress into the deck. She saw me and I went to take off my hat until I realized hadn't noticed when I'd lost it.

"Quite the scare," I said in Parisian.

"Quite, Thank heaven for our deliverance," she said.

"If you look over that way really close, you'll see the Greek mountains a shade darker than the sky. That means land is close again. I duobt we'll be in much trouble from here. The sun will be up soon to help in our drying ourselves. Where are you going risking this travel?" I asked.

"My husband is to meet me in port at Constantinople. He's found work there from the Sultan's family as a court portaitist," she said.

"Well, to family, that's a worthwhile destination," I said.

"Are you off to family too?" she asked.

"Oh heavens no. I left my wife and two daughters in Kronstadt, the other direction," I said, pointing into the darkness.

"Why would you do that?" she said.

"They are will family. I was in need of adventure. A doctor's time is best spent with people in need," I said.

"I see," she said, not sharing her epiphany.

As the conversation stifled I lost my interest and turned it to the mountains, fuller in view now. Soon they would break to reveal the straight of Bosphorus. The cradle of the ancient city of Byzantium, and the gateway to Asia.
