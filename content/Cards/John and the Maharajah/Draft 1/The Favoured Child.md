"I won't let you touch them," said the widow.

"Tell her if I don't prick them with this needle, they'll die," I said.

The lingua franca of the village was Aramaic, Jesus's tongue. Antun spoke it as his first language and was essential for translating between myself and the locals in time crunches like this one. The village had been ravaged by smallpox, killing adults and children alike. The Emir had confided this when I'd made my deal with him, having asked if I could handle such an issue. I made it clear that I had the skills to handle the treatment for and the logistical prowess to handle it at scale, provided I had the men to help. Upon my request, he made plans for a  smallpox lymph from Aleppo to be transported ahead of my arrival. It came from a British doctor stationed there so I knew it would have some efficacy for it's purpose. He had been skeptical and I'd assured him it was a back-up rather than my main course of action.

Now the widow was in front of me. Her husband dead from the pox a few weeks earlier, and she had her son and daughter on each leg. She had a face from a lifetime of worry and fear and the kids were adapting to fit her mold rather quickly. The girl was crying, the younger of the two semi-orphans. The widow stroked the girl an held her tighter while her son had to keep pulling himself back onto her other knee each time he fell off. She seldom looked at him, no doubt reminding her of her husband who's fled in death and deserted them.

Being right is not enough. Persuasion is part of a doctor's training, and mine needed work.

"I won't let you touch my beauty," she said.

"Tell her to let us innoculate the boy. Then tell her if he shows how ill wear, in a week she'll think about innoculating the girl," I gambited.

"Sure," said the widow.

I pulled out the lymph and my needle out of it's case and stuck the tip of the needle into the lymph, a pustule of smallpox taken from a patient and kept alive through the transport. Some lymphs withered quickly while others lasted. This one looked like it was withering now, but it was the only one I had.

"Hold the boy," I said.

The child squirmed but Antun grabbed him and stilled him with force on his shoulders. He cried loudly, which his sister echoed. The women kept her lips bit.

"Hold still," I shouted over the wailing.

I poked the needle into the flesh of his forearm and his scream got louder. Once I was done he tried to grab his arm but I blocked it.

"Hold tighter next time," I seethed at Antun, who bowed his head in acknowledgement.

"Tell her it will leave a rounded scar. That means it worked well," I said, while wiping the needle and stowing both it and the nymph for the next patient. I rolled up my shirt sleeve and showed her mine own, only stopping once she'd nodded.

And so it went, my innoculation campaign. Met with hesitant from the simple locals. I understood it, even if it angered me. Nothing about my dress or manners signalled competency to these people. I took it as a humbling. Antun had not hesitated in my inoculating him before we started work, but we couldn't wait for his weeklong waiting period as more people had to be helped.

I had hoped people would come to me, but I had to go shack to shack taking care of the people. I visited the homes of the people and saw how they lived and missed the home of my family for the first time. Konstady was a small town but civilised.

SEQUEL DESCRIBING HOW HIS HOMETOWN IS SO WE GET TO KNOW HIS ORIGIN.

I had grown fond of Antun's younger sisters and given them many tonics to ward off the maladies of the east I was aware of. They had laughed at my orange feet and I had stomped around like an idiot to please them more. My Ioana was much older now, and I missed her younger years. Now she was a rebel.

DESCRIBE IOANA.

GROWS A RESPECT FOR ANTUN AND HOW HE WORKS.

It had been eight days and we had not heard from the widow so we ventured to visit her. She was a quarter mile away from Antun's home in winding streets. When we arrived the mother was in mourning. 

"Ask her what happened," I said.

"She says she has been punished be the heavens. She says that her daughter died from the pox," Antun translated.

"And the boy?" I asked impatiently.

"He's alive,"

The widow called the boy, Ibrahim, from behind the curtain.

He came out with teary eyes and large pustules like pearls on his arms.

"Tell her it is not God who has punished her, but her own insolence." I turned to leave, knowing that Antun would not pass own my words, and they would live him and I alone.
