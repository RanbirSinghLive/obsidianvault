It had only been 80 years since this ancient city was known again to the world. Only two dozen Europeans had put new footprints here since. These ancient ruins sparked a desire for adventurers like me to come east. I had seen sketching of this in the Imperial Society circular and now I was here. The still arches of Roman nature. The eroded pillars of keeps. Everything the colour of the desert working hard to swallow it up and reunited the landscape with the people buried underneath it. I was looking at one of those people now. He lay a skeleton, no doubt more than a millennia old. I assume he is a man from the wealth he had. He was a few bones laid out in the places they would be if he was placed whole. Around him were coins. I heard one of them up to reveal a Roman emperor.[^1]

"I don't think the King of England, the Austrian Emperor or even the Ottoman Sultan would let you even buy an old foot with those," said Isaac.

"You just stick close to the caravan and make sure they don't fly off at the first sight of natives," I barked.

That got him doubling back, not wanting to trust our desert navigation to Antun, a city-slicker by comparison to our caravan friends. It was headed by NAME who had been patient with our infrequent requests for detours to likely tombs, in exchange for doses of my opiate powder at night to take the edge off his elder limbs.

"This is a great sin, to steal, from a dead man no less," Antun said.
 
"These coins belong in a museum or a society collection so they can be admired and learned from. Perhaps this is a little known emperor from Rome and this coin's inscription tells us something new about his reign? If some dirty bedouin found it they'd melt it and use it to make a necklace. I can't allow that waste," I said.

"Well it's in a grave. Disturbing it is a sin," Antun didn't let up.

"You're a Christian. This is a pagan grave. This man will have already been banished to hell and his bones are worthless. His soul is gone to damnation or salvation and all this,"

I circled the fossil and treasures with wide gestures.

"It's just the last crumbs waiting to crumble to sand and then the whispers of this man will be gone for good. He may be before the time of your Christ and have had no chance to have wordly knowledge of him," I said.

"God sees all, including this pillaging. What are your plans? To take this and turn it into money for wine? I find it hard to know what you plan to do with all the money you'll soon be making if your much flouted plans come to creation," Antun said.

"The Asiatic Society of Paris," I said, not looking at him as I put coins into a pouch I'd detached from my camel.

"I will source a collection of rate antiques and dispatch them to their chief of archaeology. They will make etchings and publish our findings in the local papers. From Paris, the civilized world takes it's clue and my name will be known. Then I can return and pivot that renown into a Occidental prosperity," I said.

"You will first need to safely transport the riches across a great distance," Antun said.

"If we can transport ourselves, we can transport this," I said

A stir emanated from the caravan. Issac's donkey trotted back towards them kicking up sand. The ass had been propelled by a slap on it's namesake as Isaac was no more capable a rider than myself.

"They see Bedouin coming. We must leave at once," Isaac said.

"But we have your letter," I said, hesitating to hurry up.

"Well, ahem, that letter... I wouldn't trust the temperament of some illiterate marauders to some sun-faded caligraphy. Let's hurry," Isaac said.

When he was out of earshot, I leaned towards Antun, patting sand off his seat.

"I knew that drunkard was full of shit," Antun said.
