# Summary
In short, personal finance is how you align Your Money With The Life You Want To Live. This can be as simple as **seven steps**

## Step 1: Redefine Money
- Money is the root of all evil
- Money is the means to an end
- We tell ourselves stories about money because have a hard time connecting the tangible with the financial
- Think of money a different way: Money is Your Life Energy
- You trade an hour or a month of your life for an hourly wage or a salary
- You are never getting that time back. It is gone forever.
- If you make $15 an hour and spend $30 on lunch, you just spent 2 hours of your life working for that lunch
- Money is what you get in exchange for the precious hours of your life. Spend it Wisely.

## Step 2: Count Your Money
- To get smart about your finances, you need to figure out what you're working with
- Start with your assets
- This is anything you own that has monetary value
- On a spreadsheet, make two columns - put the asset name in one and the dollar value in the other
- This could be the money in your bank accounts, under your mattress, investment, and anything you could resell for some money, like a car
- Be honest about what you could sell things for
- Now we'll lay out your liabilities
- This is money or goods you've borrowed
- Write these down in two columns
- List all debt - like credit cards, student loans and money you owe your parents
- Total up both sections
- Take your total assets minus your total liabilities and you have your Net Worth
- There's a good chance the number will be negative
- There's no shame to be had here
- We want to work on getting that number positive over time
- The most important thing is to set a baseline and we'll go from there

## Step 3: Budget
- Budgeting is actually two things
	- goal setting for the next month and the future
	- tracking progress towards these goals
- For many, budgeting monthly is a good cadence
- There's many ways to do it, here's an easy one to get you started
- In another tab of your spreadsheet, make a column with all your spending categories
- These are things like:
	-   Rent
	-   Utilities
	-   Groceries
	-   Transport
	-   Monthly minimum debt payments
- Use your previous month's activity as a guide to customize this for yourself
- It's OK if you miss things initially, just course correct at the end of your first month. No shame
- Track every dollar that goes out
- In a separate chart, track your total monthly income, total monthly spend, and what the variance is
- If it's positive, that means you're saving money that month
- If it's negative that means you're losing money or taking on debt
- Even if your net worth is negative, you **need** your monthly balance to be positive
- If it's negative, trim expenses or increase earnings until it is
- this will give you positive cash flow that you can improve over time
- Work to make more than your spend, even by $10 to start

## Step 4: Save
- Once you've confirmed you have enough cash flow to support your present, you can start saving for your future
- In your  budget, allocate money for your savings goals before you allocate towards other expenses
- This is called 'paying yourself first' and is more psychologically effective than simply saving after the fact
- Here is a sample idea of what to save for:
	- An emergency fund for 1 month of your usual expenses
	- Repay high interest debt (10% or higher) i.e. credit cards - don't carry a balance at all costs
	- If your employer has a matching pension fund, increase your contributions to the max that will be matched and no more. This is free money
	- Increase emergency fund to 3-6 months
- **Do not invest your emergency fund**
- It should be liquid so you can use it whenever you need it


## Step 5: Invest
- Increasing your savings gives you psychological and financial safety to start taking calculated risks in hope of greater rewards
- This shouldn't be stress inducing
- low risk is better than no risk and high risk. the sweet spot
- Investment could be in this order:
	- Education/Skills - best upside for $ spent - i.e. $200 photoshop course gives you a baseline marketable skill that you can improve for life
	- Meaningful experiences (growth travel) - do anything but go sit at a resort. Go somewhere foreign to you and talk to people
	- Mid-Term Expenses - i.e. car or expected increase in rent from moving out
	- Index Funds - buy cheap, diversified ones

## Step 6: Accelerate
- Eventually you'll be in a solid enough financial footing to start accelerating your financial investing
- Here are some laws of the investing universe to help you aong
	- time and compound growth will win. Period
	- minimize risk instead of maximizing losses
	- diversification is key to lowering risk
- Index funds obey these laws
- They are a low mtc path towards passive income and financial independence
- Here are some tips to help you get there:
	- 1.Max out tax sheltered investments:
		- 1.TFSA
		- 2.RRSP
		- 3.Company Pension
2. ^All have their unique uses
3. Buy the haystack, not the needle
	1. 1.Â  Most canâ€™t beat theÂ  market over time
	2. Â Â  2.Â  Avoid fees at all costs
	3. Â Â  3.Â  Donâ€™t get upsoldÂ Â  
	4. 4.Â Get comfortable self-managing

## Step 7: The Crossover Point
- With index funds, you can start doing fun charting
- Make a line graph with 3 lines
- Show your income and expenses forecasted out into the future as 2 of the lines
- Make assumptions on raises, cost of living and lifestyle
- This is just a forecast so play around
- Make the third line your assumed passive investment growth
- At one point your passive investments will â€˜crossoverâ€™ your expenses
- Then is when you can retire, or do what you want in life
- here is what it could look like
- hope this was 3 minutes well spent. bye
