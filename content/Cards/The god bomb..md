We're just chimpanzees in suits.

There is no intrinsic goal to being here, so we're just running up and down the field with no aim.

God was created to provide a goal.

We created the atomic bomb and an awe-inspiring force escaped us and is now bigger than all of us combined, so we must respect it and our lives are governed by it's threat.

Why couldn't we view God the same way. Created by us, but now in charge. Perhaps AI will move the same way.

The choice is that God's power is mitigated by belief.

At an Anglican service today, the priest said non-believers see birth,life,death but believers get life,death,life. The choice is to believe.

So God is the hydrogen bomb we can each individually arm or disarm in our personal lives.
