- This is how you find yourself while growing in Twitter and not prior
- If you're on twitter just to grow you will flounder and quit
- Tweeting can be a tool to think clearer and find emergence through your work
- Export tweets to obsidian
- Later on this emergence will come from comments on your own content, making it even more laser focused on your niche
- As you think clearer, followers will just become a bi-product 
- Find a way to export your tweets and scrape them for word repetition 
- You're not supposed to find your niche before you start writing
- You find it while your writing
- But what do you do to start?
- Most people recommend a braindump
- I recommend you become an active consumer 
- Consumer > active consumer > creator 
- For your bio don't worry about niche
- Pic, banner with matching colour,  no words, and SOMETHING about your personality 
- Your personality will come across in your writing so this wont be a lie
- Then you can iterate you bio once you do the above process
- Your feed becomes writing prompts 
- If you find searching for a creator or topic, that's a signal to focus on the topic or handcopy the creator 
- This can be started with 0 followers 
- At first, you should be RELIEVED that you have 0 followers. This is your time to be all over the place. Follow people with no mind for common niche etc.
