Istanbul is a land of may eras of history. 

The Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman & Turkish eras all exist in architecture.

The Hagia Sophia is the epitomy of this.

Some building are big enough that the next power decides they can stay.

My sikh temple used to be a baptist church. The stained glass remains, just like images of Jesus lie underneath the Hagia Sophia.
