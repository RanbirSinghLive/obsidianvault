#ðŸª´

Having a vault full of tasks like: 
- [ ] process this note
- [ ] write that note

is not how to build a digital garden.

I spend the rest of my day absorbed in task-based work.

[[Task-based workflows beat whim-based for non-creative work]], but they're not appropriate for deep creative work.

Deep creative work should feel more like play to be effective. You sacrifice productivity, but that's necessary to allow for complexity.

Tasks are designed to deconstruct complexity. Creatives must live within complexity for novel ideas to germinate.
