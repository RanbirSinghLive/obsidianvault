I have an idea for a book about them, but before I do more research, why do I find it interesting?

Character change: we could have a patriotic sikh turn revolutionary due to the events of the novel

I don't want to pick a side, simply lay out a compelling story that gives good reasons for multiple moral conclusions from the real life events

- How Sikhs were simultaneously terrorists and patriots during this time
- Did they know her long before the day they killed her?
- How did they rise to that rank?
- How was India in general during the emergency?
- How much is known about them?

Ok, now I feel I do some research.

- The killings led to anti-sikh riots, killing more sikhs
- her son came to power
-
