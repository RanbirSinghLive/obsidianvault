I just hit 100 followers.

Here are 100 lessons I would teach my zero-follower self:

- Followers are a lagging indicator of your success
- Write down 1 important task, get it done & cross it out. Repeat
- Drink more water
---
- Those hours you spent brainstorming a niche couldâ€™ve been spent writing & shipping
- Write down your wins. Youâ€™ll need to draw from them sooner than you think.
- If you worry about your boss finding out about your Twitter account, youâ€™re either living a lie online or at work. Figure out which & address it
- Itâ€™s not clickbait if you back it up @Nicolascole77
- Niches are meant to be iterated.
	- Here are my past iterations:
		- Middle Manager
		- The Networker
		- Content Operations
		- Digital Writing Coach
		- Ranbir Singh
- Nuance doesn't scale @jackbutcher
- Evergreen content compounds. Timely content gets attention. Use both.
- The more you engage & tweet, the faster you grow. This is as true as the laws of physics.
- Writing is the highest leverage activity. 
- Notion is a procrastination system disguised as a productivity system.
- Your hooks should illicit an extraordinary reaction. If they go 'meh' they scroll.
- Twitter is just psychology at scale @thekierandrew
- High-growth days are followed immediately by low-growth days
- Identifying ideas & writing them down throughout the day is a 6th sense
- The Novelty Paradox: No idea is new but we're all unique
- Aim for something bigger than starting a Twitter growth course
- Doing > Writing > Talking > Thinking
- Don't solely tweet about tweeting. That gets old fast.
- Don't set goals. Embody an identity & ask 'what would they do?'
- You have a maximum of 80 years left to live. Act like it.
- Balance depth & width
- No matter how high-brow of a writer you think you are, you need to write 'likebait' to reach people
- Antisocial writers are bad writers. The best writing comes from social experience
- Tweet 80% growth, 10% authority & 10% personality
- Picking a sick domain name is an excellent hack to start a business idea
- Write down every question you're asked online & see what patterns emerge
- Learn the Decoy Effect before you price any offer
- Most people have 3,000 unread emails & no to-do list. Help them.
- Don't hate the player, play the game
- Make decisions easy for busy people & you will win @perell
- Positive Feedback loops are powerful or dangerous (depending on the input)
- A lot of things are considered true only because everyone considers them true
- Nobody cares about anything you do. This should be [[freeing]]
- There's an optimal level of stress. And it isn't zero.
- Do things that don't scale @paulg
- Experiments aren't meant to succeed. They're meant to gather data.
- You don't pick a niche just like you don't pick a passion. They're both discovered through exploration
- You need to pick an audience whose problems you donâ€™t mind living in all day long
- You want to read minds and make them think â€˜how did he know I was thinking that?â€™
- The more you know, the more you realize you donâ€™t know.
- You never 'get there.' You become the newest member of a different club @alexhormozi 
- Read the oldest work in your field (I'm talking 1800s here)
- Send 1 cold DM a day
- Exciting events only make up 10% of your life. Focus on [[Get the mundane things right|getting the mundane things]] right to live a good one.

- Nobody's listening until you can prove credibility
- Say the same thing 1,000 different ways. It won't click for some people until #963
- Your environment determines your destiny more than you'd like to admit
- If you read a landing page & buy the product, handcopy every word of it to learn why
- Lean into embarrassment to accelerate growth
- Some problems call for surgery, and some just call for a triage nurse
- If you look forward to Mondays, you should be grateful
- Make sure you're not fooling yourself
- If something can't be quantified, it doesn't mean it isn't important
- Middle managers get a bad rap
- Think about what you want your ideal life to be & then write your way towards it
- Twitter & OnlyFans both allow you to create content while naked
- Do what feels like play to you but feels like work to others @naval
- Being a politician is hard because anytime you speak you need to try to appeal to both 33-year-old me and my 80-year-old uncle
- On a related note, If you're talking to everyone, you're talking to no one
- [[Journalling is time travel |Journaling is the closest thing to time travel we have]]
- Solve your own problems & should people how you did it. That's all you need to do to succeed on Twitter @thedankoe
- [[Resume | Personal website > paper resume]]
- Storytelling is just writing about change over time
- Failure is more compelling than success
- Build a swipe file
- Most truth facts can be paired with equally true yet contradictory facts
- If you can't explain something to a 5-year-old, you are not a master
- I wrote most of this thread by browsing my 2nd brain in Obsidian for ideas I've captured & written. It's only after a year of this habit that I'm feeling the true compounding benefit

- The perfect business: "Something that costs a penny, can sell for a dollar and is habit forming." @alexhormozi

- Offers are a waste of time at <100 followers. Just tweet & engage.
- Do your potential audience a favour & build a good bio (pic, copy, banner)
- Ask people to R/T & follow at the end of a thread. It actually helps
- Wake up at the same time everyday
- Most Twitter advice is for 21 year-olds. Adjust accordingly to your life stage
- You're special enough to have something to write about, but not special enough that the rules of hard work don't apply to you
- Having enough is a rebellious act
- The only Personal Finance advice you need could fit on an index card, but fintwit can turn that into years of content. Learn from that
- Make your daily habits frictionless enough to continue on vacation. Vacations are habit killers
- Don't follow anyone's advice to the letter. You are meant to apply it to your situation. That's the whole point of this
- Spend some time writing out your backstory in a compelling way. This will help you position yourself to your audience
- Get used to asking & answering the 'big questions' (meaning of life, core values) You'll need these solid as you get older
- Being Good at Something Doesnâ€™t Mean You Can or should Do it as a Business
- A zettelkasten requires years of effort before it pays off
- Take your notebook everywhere so you can take notes everywhere
- Don't be tempted by simple answers to complex problems (even though they do make for good tweets)
