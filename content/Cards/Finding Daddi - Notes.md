# Notes

God, kill me is a literal transaction of the Punjabi saying "Nee mai marjan" ^-me7c

Babbu wants to get to know Happy for a number of reasons: ^osk3o
- He wants a son of his own
- He wants to get close to the family for intel
- He wants Happy to like him despite what he'll end up doing

This felt like the biggest wasted expense of my youth but in actuality it probably allowed me to be more computer literate than my peers and equalized the playing field for my tech-forward disposition. ^-qkgp

Have Happy hold these in place with hair gel on his first day of school. ^upolw

Minder Uncle and Jagpreet Auntie weren't moving out of the big apartment for another month. ^xhfy9

Mummi shuts it down the offer and tries to put distance between the 2 of them. ^0uhz9

This is subtext that his dad goes missing often. ^681tc

# Beats

- Happy moves things from 219 to 504 while bouncing between orders from family members
- Mummi and Jagpreet get in a big fight about the move
- Mummi tells Happy to go look for Daddi, who is missing
- The search is futile and Happy comes home for dinner
- The police bring a drunk and bloody Daddi home in the night

# Conflicts and Drives

- Happy - Is meek and overwhelmed by the controlling nature of his mum and the absence of his dad
- Mummi - is nervous about losing further control of her family and piles it all onto Happy
- Daddi - is disengaged from family life and would rather be with his friends
- Jagpreet - is trying to break free from Mummi's control to have her own life
- Minder - Is overwhelmed by his mental state and is looking for someone to take control of him
- Babbu - is keenly watching the family from a position of interest in Jagpreet
- Jimmy wants to go to bed

# Background
