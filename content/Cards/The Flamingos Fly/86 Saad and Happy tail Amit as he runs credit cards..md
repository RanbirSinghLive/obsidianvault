It took them two hours of waiting outside Amit's building for him to come out. He lives at a condo on the other end of the Kipling strip that was a bit better than either of their buildings. It sat across for a city park with a drive-in path, which made it the perfect place to park and watch from afar.

At last, a car with a beautiful Punjabi girl pulled up and Amit came downstairs in luxe clothing and sunglasses to get in. The car pulled out, the girl must've been a couple years older judging by her ability to drive unchaperoned and the price of the car. The license plate said 'Sharon86' so that was a correct assertion.

"Stay a little back," Saad said.

It wasn't hard as the all-white SUV was easy to spot down Kipling and merging into the 401. They followed the car across the highway as the hood melted away into old industrial Toronto which melted away into middle class suburban Toronto which melted away into the doorstep of Yorkdale Shopping Centre - a monument to the consumerist excess of the cities successful that had to be built north of the sprawl as a vanguard of their stamp on the provinces.

Happy parked the car in the lane behind Sharon's and turned off his car quickly. They creeked their windows down and heard the doors on the SUV pop and slam shut as Sharon and Amit went inside. When Happy got out and peeked up over the car beside them he clocked the couple holding hands with their other hands empty ready to grub at luxury.

Inside, they tailed them until they kissed and parted ways. Saad continued to tail Amit while Happy switched to Sharon. She waked into a jewellery shop and picked out a few necklaces that she liked. When she found one suitable she paid for it. From there, she continued on to a few luxury stores and bought some menswear, no doubt fashioned as gifts for her husband. Each time she pulled out her bejewelled clutch and paid with a different credit card. Happy was able to get close to her at one store since she didn't know who he was and Amit was nowhere in site. The clutch held a dozen cards and she had them each filed away with a memory of which one was to deployed at each store.

When she was done she went outside the store to where Amit was waiting in a chair, like a bored husband. They kissed and walked out.

Happy wondered Sweety had been roped into doing this herself and what role it played in their break-up.

The tailing continued until Sharon dropped Amit off at a friend's parking lot, deep in the back somewhere off Steeles. Amit left Sharon with the jewellry and kept everything else. The car was his older brother Billa's and they sat in the front seats and smoked weed. Saad played with the gun in his lap.

"So they flip the goods they bought for cash?" Happy said.

"That's the game," Saad said, distracted.

"This is the perfect spot to pop them," Happy said, chattering through nervous clacking teeth.

Saad sat fuming.

"It's gonna be hard to hit them both," Saad said.

Happy thought for a moment. He didn't know totally what he was doing before he spoke next.

"I could tackle the other one if they try to get away," Happy said.

"They'll have your DNA over them. You ain't watched CSI?" Saad said.

"OK then we're just sitting here risking shit. Should I drive away?" Happy said, getting cockier by the second.

"Let me think," Saad said, gripping the gun tighter.

Happy sat silently, checking his review, side mirror and Saad on roation.

"Let drive," Saad said.

Happy took note, and complied.
