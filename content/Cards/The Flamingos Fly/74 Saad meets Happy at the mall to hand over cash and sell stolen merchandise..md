Happy drove straight to the parking lot of Albion Mall from jail. He wore his new Phat Farm hoodie as the weather had turned unseasonably cold for still technically being winter. He had gone shopping the day prior in his 'new' car that was hobbling down the road with rumblings it would need some repair expenditures soon.

He pulled into the parking lot and eyed down a white Honda SUV parked near the fried chicken spot. Happy come smell the cooking oil through the closed car windows, making him question the car's airtightness in general. He saw an elderly couple in the front two seats and flashed his high beams at them. It was the daytime so it served as softer signal than if they'd tried this exchange at night. He'd done that once and the mutual distrust made it a much rougher barter.

The couple exited their car and approached.

"Hi are you Happy?" the man said.

"Always," Happy said, with a smile.

This illicited a suspicious chuckle from the man.

"Alright here it is," Happy said, popping his trunk.

The brand new toilet sat in it's packaging, on it's side.

"How do we know it works?" the woman said.

"I mean, it's hard to test it here, but you can open the box here and look for chips and cracks. Kind of hard for it to not work, and at the price I'm giving it away, you're getting a steal," Happy said.

Happy pulled out his switchblade causing a flinch from the woman and cut over the top tape on the box. He puled open the four flaps and stepped away from the trunk, putting the knife away reassuredly.

The man looked inside but Happy and him both knew there wasn't much to gander without pulling the whole thing out. This gave him enough cover to satisfy his wife that he'd tried. Happy banked on that being enough to secure the $200.

"Why don't you need it anymore?" the man said.

"I'm a contractor. This was leftover from a full house reno and the owners left ust with all the extras. Rich couple in Rosedale. Their laziness is my gain," Happy said.

Happy looked over to the doors leading into the mall's liquor store and saw Babbu walking in. How could he still be hanging around this neighbouhood after what he did? Then Happy remembered his Daddi wouldn't do shit.

The man counted the cash and handed it Happy who then offered to install it in their trunk.

He shook his hand and they quickly departed the ethnic enclave.

Happy turned his attention to the mall's interior.
