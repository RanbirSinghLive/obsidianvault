Happy waited outside Shera's house. He'd been waiting a while.

His front lawn was nice and his father worked hard to pay for the landscaper who did so. A while ago Shera had switched his digs to the basement to gain more privacy, independence and distance from radio antennae.

Happy called his house phone again with his new cellphone. It was a simple one he'd bought at the mall.

This time Shera picked up.

"Where you at?" Happy said.

"Yo I'm gonna chill here," Shera said.

"What? We need to ride out. I lost my job and we need to figure out how to get more money in this bitch," Happy said.

"Yo good luck with that. I heard about the crash and things are getting hot. I'm trying to keep a low profile," Shera said.

"You're trying to get blitzed," Happy said.

"You'd be medicating if you knew all the shit I do. I keep trying to enlighten you," Shera said.

"The fuck," Happy said.

"If you wanna hang here we can," Shera said.

"I'm good. Thanks so much *brother*," Happy said.

Happy threw the phone in the passenger seat without hanging up.

He had had the worst week of his life and now his friend was decoupling from reality. If only he had that luxury, but he had a revenge to plan with Saad. On to 777 it was.
