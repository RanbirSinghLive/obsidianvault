How could Dilmit have allowed him to do that? She was his girl and he was his boy. He'd treated her rough but that's what she deserved for being his second choice. She was clingy and cringy, but she was his. He deserved her at least as a consolation prize. He'd gotten dressed up to be here for her as he was supposed to. Why couldn't she behave instead of being a slut?

Happy heard a glass break inside the auditorium through the barred windows behind him. Yelling quickly followed and puttered away as the disruption levelled out.

And Ram, he'd been his best friend since second grade. Happy had finally found a way to be his equal and he'd immediately clapped back and tried to embarass him in front of the whole school.

Happy's face felt hot.  He took some deep breathes to try and calm himself. His heart rate started decreasing.

The double doors at the back of the school opened and Saad stepped out. He had beads of sweat on his forehead and wiped them with the bandana he'd kept peaking out of his back suit pocket to subtly act out in front of the teachers.

"Yo Happy, that was messed up," Saad said.

"Yeah i can't believe she would dance with him," Happy said.

"Her, what's she supposed to do? That nerd was persistent and she just clapped along. You should be cheesed at him, not her," Saad said.

"Yeah Ram's fucked too," Happy said.

"You know him? You guys beefing?" Saad said.

"Nah he's my best friend," Happy said.

"Well shit, with friends like that you don't need enemies," Saad said.

"Yeah, I don't think we're friends anymore," Happy said.

"No shit, he's all on your bitch. Hey you know what, I think I can get him out here," Saad said.

"Oh, what then?" Happy said.

"You whoop his fucking ass," Saad said.

"What are you going to say to get him out here," Happy said.

"I'm going to say you want to talk to him, that's all. We ain't playing tricks, we're getting busy," Saad said.

Happy knew he had to act if he wanted to regain his reputation from the kickless kick in the Odaine encounter.

"Will you come with him?" Happy said.

"Of course, we're brother now," Saad said.

Saad walked in while Happy felt the sudden need to pee. His time was coming and his teeth were chattering.
