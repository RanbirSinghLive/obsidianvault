Happy drove the speed limit down Kipling the opposite direction from the police station. He thought about what to do and where to go but the answer came to him quite naturally.

He pressed his brakes but they didn't work well. His foot pushed harder as the pedal slowly sank, resulting in a gradual stop instead of a powered stop. This wasn't great. He had to time his stops at the next few lights to match with the extra distance and time he needed to stop. He wasn't pulling over, it wasn't an option to call a tow truck and get questions asked.

He drove until he reached Steels and took a left, his one headlight guiding the way. He quickyl ducked into a side street strip mall and found the car garage he was looking. He parked in front, turned his car off, leaned his head and went to sleep.

When he awoke he could taste the congealed blood on his gums. The sign infront of him was illuminated now - Gobind's auto body repair. He knew someone was home. He got out of his car and walked towards the door without peaking at the damage as his gut couldn't take it.

Inside, there was no one in the makeshift waiting room that reminded him of dusty roadside stalls in India with bare chairs and concrete floors. He called into the back until Gobind came out, taller and more muscular than he remembered, with a thick beard trimmed into a point with a newly rocking turban.

When he saw Happy he clasped the palms of his hands together held high in the universal Sikh greeeting

"Waheguru ji ka khalsa, waheguru ji ki fateh," Gobind said.

Happy quickly clasped his hands in kind and fell in line to the salute halfway through so they finished in harmony.

Gobind stood inquisitively, knowing Happy was the one with explaining to do.

"Bro, how you been?" Happy said.

"Good, what's wrong?" Gobind said.

Happy heaved a sigh until he started rambling.

"I got in an accident last night and came right here. The front bumper and light are all fucked up. Also the brakes are gone. We're beefing hard and I don't want to go to the cops, I don't know what's supposed to happen, am I supposed to call insurance or what?" Happy said.

"Was there another car involved?" Gobind said.

"No just a pole," Happy said.

"Was there anyone hurt?" Gobind said, looking at Happy's lip.

"No there wasn't from the crash. I got these from Billa. I just pushed him to the ground but I don't think he's got any injuries he can pin to this," Happy said.

Gobind thought, looking into the parking lot

"Old car," Gobind said.

"Yeah it's older than me, I don't really care about it if that helps," Happt said.

"Yeah it does. Alright, give me the keys. I'm going to fix it to the point no one can see it got fucked up, and redo your brake line. That will be the cheapest, safest way to go. But I don't know how well it will run. You can pay me for this and then come back if you want anything else," Gobind said.

"Deal," Happy said.

"And then when I'm done you need to drive the fuck out of this situation. I thought you would be better off by now. When I last saw you you were a nerd trying to act tough and now you're the lamest tough guy. You're in the wrong arena brother. I left that shit behind, gang, school, everything. Now I'm running my own business under my bro's name and I'm the best I've ever been. This life ain't for you bro and I hope you learn from this shit," Gobind said.

"Yeah, I'm learning real fast, real head, real painful," Happy said.
