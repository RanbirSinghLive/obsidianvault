Happy sat cross-legged on the floor in the mens section of the *darbar sahib* listening to the *granthis* sing hymns. At the head of the room, the seat of the Sikh holy book, his living guru, was surrounded in 4 gold columns and a roof like the bed of a Victorian colonial lord. To the right of the holy seat were three seated men with instruments and microphones. Two of them were playing the harmonium, a mix accordian/keyboard. It was played by pushing air into it and then pressing the keys. The third man had tablas, two twin drums played with each hand. He was the one singing the loudest. Happy nodded off and shook himself awake. The man on the tabla was not a man but in fact Shera.

Happy was thinking about Dilmit and how he wanted to kiss her but he was worried about everyone laughing at him. He wanted Sweety but he got Dilmit. He also knew she had a boyfriend before which made him mad. What had she done with him that she wouldn't do with Happy? Was it still worth it to get with her if she wasn't a virgin?

He was excited that he had found a way into the gang. He had a girlfriend now, even if she was a starter girlfriend. Maybe she could be the one. She was pure Punjabi and a great wife material. He also had value to give the gang. He had already begun doing homework assignments for them once he got home. This would allow him to have value for the gang besides physical, which he lacked, but he could go to the gym to earn it if he wanted anytime. He was also a *sardar* which everyone valued as a high integrity archetype. He had to live up to it by being a learned one.

After the penultimate standing prayer, a volunteer passed out the offering (sugary dough balls) to the sparse Saturday morning contingent and Happy knew the proceeding was coming to a close.

Ms. Grant had ordained that every kid needed 8 volunteer hours to pass civics class. Shera had suggested they come to the gurdwara since that's what he was doing anyway on the weekend. This was also one of the only outings his mum would sanction during his grounding. Also, Money's comments on him staying true to his faith as his differentiator for bringing value to the gang stuck with him. 

He'd found a new way to break in and his turban was the ticket.
