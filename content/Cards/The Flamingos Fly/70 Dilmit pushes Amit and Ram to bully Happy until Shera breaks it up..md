Happy saw Dilmit whisper something at Ram while Amit stepped out towards Happy.

Ram was now class president as of today. He'd put himself up for election and won as head of the graduating class. He'd spent the past two years jockeying for influence in every social club and circle on the brown side of the school. The black side voted a lot less and had less scholars to shore up influence so Ram had made symbolic overtures there to keep the piece on his character at least.

Amit had adapted to a reality in which he can blend both worlds. This was a tact that both Saad and Happy were ill equipped to use themselves. Saad being expelled and in a different social world in Vaughan, run by rich jewish kids. Happy uncharming and hairy and a loner.

"What's up loner," Amit said, now square in Happy's path.

"Just chillin bro," Happy said.

He cheesed super hard to show his comfort in the situation. His smile was too intense and it gave off hints of crazy. Despite having worked out and done his best to bulk up in the preceding two years, Amit was still talller and had continued to grow taller, to the point where he could easily take Happy in a fight.

It was for this reason that Happy thumbed with the switchblade in his pocket, which he would pull out of Amit tried anything too critical. A shove or slap wasn't enough to go to jail. but a beatdown was. Amit valued his life too much to get too involved, but he probably underestimated Happy's desire to respond.

Amit wound up and gave Happy a big slap while Sweety tried to get in the middle. He pushed her off with one shove. While he was distracted, Happy slapped him back, making contact with his ear which he knew would ring.

Amit grabbed his ear, clearly ringing and Happy didn't step back.

Shera came in from nowhere and pushed Amit back, having a running start. He then turned about put a hand on Happy, playing that he was more neutral than he actually was.

"Yo, lets keep the peace," Shera said.

Shera had shaved his turban and beard the year prior, eager to shed the dissonance of his faith with his substance abuse. Now he happily looked like everyone else, and could behave like them too. His increasing paranoia also fed into his desire to slip in undetected.

Amit out his hands up, deferrent to Shera's position, but thinking through his next retaliation in a different forum.

Happy turned behind him to see Jug, who'd clearly been walking with Shera. He had not moved an inch to intervene and show any cards, which was typical for him.

"Tell Saad I said what up. He's getting soft with those Jews. I know where he be at," Amit called.

Shera and Amit were pals, but now Shera picks Happy, thus drawing stronger lines.
