They went to the mall, her pushing her grocery cart so she could walk better. They went to the Canadian Tire. Happy folded the cart and fit it into the bottom slot of the shopping cart like a russian doll and then Mummi walked with that cart instead. They walk around the store together. Mummi looks at what's on sale but puts seldom anything in her cart. Happy wanders around looking at items and using his imagination to escape from the montony of the day. 

The poem he was writing for Dilmit was meant for Sweety. He was writing of her eyes and smile, but Dilmit would be too dim to detect it. Sweety would know though if she got the poem. He was going to write one for Saad to use. Saad would benefit from Happy's skill and charm to get the girl he wanted. That wasn't fair. But it was the price he seemingly had to pay to stay in the gang. Maybe Saad would screw it up and allow Happy to slip in with Sweety. But then he worried Sweety would be soiled from her time with a lesser man.

Happy followed laggardly behind at Mummi waddled to the sock section of Canadian Tire. They sold athletic socks and winter socks for the most part in a section of racking that obscured oneself from the main view.

Mummi picked up one package of socks and saw that the plastic flip was loose. A light bulb went off. She looked around for other socks that could fit in it. She found a two pack held together only by 1 plastic strand. The loose opening was wide enough to fit the duo into the larger package without messing it up any further. 

As she commenced the overstuffing, Happy grumbled.

"What are you doing?" Happy said.

"Be quiet," Mummi said.

Mummi always did cheapskate stuff like this So what if they needed money? It wasn't worth losing their dignity. Happy hated being out in public with Mummi because she behaved like a bottomfeeder. This wasn't living. Saad, Amit, they did crimes, but they did them valiantly. They weren't stealing 2 dollars worth of socks. That 2 dollars meant nothing. Happy could've found it on the ground if he looked long enough. This couldn't go on. He had to stand up to Mummi and draw a line in the sand. She wasn't going to limit him anymore and if she wanted to spend her days doing shit like this, she could do it on her own.
