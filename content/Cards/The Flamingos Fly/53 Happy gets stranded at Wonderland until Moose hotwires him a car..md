Goal: Get home Conflict: Stranded Disaster: Crashes

---

Happy had spent the night at Saads after the fight. He hadn't wanted to stay in a house of such vile cruelty. Saad's family slept tight in a 3 bedroom with 3 parents and 4 boys. The boys slept 2 to a room and Happy had been on bed in Saad's room while Saad took a floor mattress.

The next morning they had gone to Wonderland to have fun. Moose had driven them there. It was at Wonderland that they had run into Sweety with her older sister's friends. Saad had gone up to her to catch and left with her to try some rides as Happy stayed behind sad. He stuck with Saad's other brother and never saw Saad again during the day. 

As they were leaving the park, Moose got a text from a cousin saying they should come up to Woodbridge for a family function.

"Hey bud, we're actually heading up to Woodbridge for a family function," Moose said.

"Oh, I don't know how I'd get home from here without a ride," Happy said.

"Don't worry I got you. You ever driven before?" Moose said.

"No," Happy said.

"Aight come with me," Moose said.

Moose approached a lonely, older Corolla in the parking lot and slid a long file out of his pants and down through the passenger door. He heard a click and the door opened. He hid the slide as quick as he'd unsheathed it.

"OK, slide into the driver's seat. It's like a video game. The steering wheel is the controller. Don't let it slip too far, just small turns will turn the wheels and you're head in that direction. The pedals are the buttons. The right one is for driving, but once again press it gently. The brakes should also be gentle unless you need them real quick," Moose said.

Happy put the week down under the passenger seat to get it out of the way in case he got pulled over. His beard may help him avoid that.

Happy hit the road out of the parking lot with the most clumsiness. The shocks of the car let out a crunch as he powered through a pothole. The car lurched forward and he put one hand on the dashboard to brace himself.

Moose had told him to follow Steeles and turn left at Martin Grove and them ditch the car at the junior school as that's a few blocks from each house. It's not about getting home, it's about getting close enough.

They hit the road and Happy does his best to concentrate.

Happy made it to a quiet street a few blocks from his house. He was such a hurry to get out that he forgot the weed in the passenger's seat.
