Happy pulled the travel sized bottle of gel out of his pants and squeezed a squirt into his hand. He then smeared the glob onto his sideburn and pushed it down until he got to where his sideburn ended just shy of his chin. The newly slicked side was juxtaposed by the bushier side, lifting off his skin at the morning's layer of styling gel wore off. The bushy hair made his face rounder and accentuated his abnormally full facial hair for age 14.

He was newly back to school after suspension. Since his suspension he'd become a weed dealer, and a bad one at that. He'd also become the breadwinner of his house until Daddi had gotten his EI kicked in.

Speaking of weed, he owed Amit $20 from weed that had been sold but the money hadn't come in yet. Wayne had stiffed him, and so had a random approach at the park with friends. He was lucky he hadn't been outright robbed, but still had no money to pay Amit for the mismatch. His paycheck was direct-deposited into Mummi's account and Happy couldn't get at it without her permission.

So what could he do? He had to take charge and face Amit. He'd set him up to fail with the task so he'd failed. How could be blame him? What was his end game? He had to find another way to appeal to him besides himself. He had planned a study session with Sweety. Maybe she could help him.

Happy licked his gum and breathed out. He smelled it, and then fished in his pocket for a Listerine strip. Once it had dissolved he headed for the door.
