Happy walked in the sliding doors to unnecessary air counditioning, sending a chill down his spine.

He scanned for Babbu and saw him through the windows of the liquor store getting more expensions whiskey than his Daddi. Speaking of Daddi, he looked for him at the mall and didn't see him.

Babbu settled up and walked out of the store to see Happy standing there.

"Happy," Babbu said.

"How the fuck could you do it," Happy said.

"Your auntie was unhappy and stuck beta. This is best for everyone," Babbu said.

"You're a disgusting man," Happy said.

"I love her. I will raise your cousin well and you can see him when he's older," Babbu said.

Happy grabbed Babbus' collar, now being big enough to slap him down.

"Beta," Babbu said, already drunk.

Happy eyed a security guard from the corner of his eye walking towards them with his hand on his radio. A new position given the history of the mall and encounters.

"Your auntie was miserable and your uncle needs help. You see how much your parents argue. These ways we do things are not how happy homes are made," Babbu said.

"Shut the fuck up," Happy responded in English, unable to think of a similarly suitable response in Punjabi.

"You should understand beta, you're Canadian," Babbu said.

Happy was already walking away, pulling his hoodie over his head to hide his appearance.
