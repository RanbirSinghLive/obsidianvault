"Things have been wild at school I hear," Billa said.

"I don't know about that, just trying to keep a low profile myself," Happy said.

"That's not what my cousin said," Billa said.

"Billa man, I'm not trying to get into any shit. You know I don't fuck around," Happy said, watching the traffic ahead as much as possible so as not to make eye contact.

"Oh yeah, but you riding around with Saad and Moose and them though? You know we've have beef for time. That means you're dancing that dance," Billa said.

"I thought you and Moose squashed that shit way back," Happy said.

"Yes but nothing is ever really squashed my brother. That's my superpower," Billa said, slurring.

"What're you talking about?" Happy said.

"I'm vaila bro," Billa said.

"I don't get it," Happy said, hoping to keep the conversation long enough to get to the drop off.

"They all say I'm a fuck-up drug addict who's lounging on daddy's time while everyone else moves on with their lives. But what that really means is I got *nothing better to do* than beef. I heard Moose is getting engaged. Maybe I'll be there. I heard you got in a teeny tiny thing with my cousin. That's why I'm here. Y'all got lives you want to live. I got everything I need in my bank account and in my veins. This is what I live for," Billa said.

"Billa man..." 

Everything went blurry. Then immense pain. Then Happy's eyes started reorienting. Giselle screamed. 

Billa has punched in the jaw.

"What the fuck..."

Billa punched him again. It wasn't an onslaught, he was casually punching him as hard as he couch.

The car swerved. Happy held out a hand and grabbed one of Billa's wrists. 

"Hold on bro. I'm fucking driving you. Jug help me man," Happy said.

Jug reached from the bag and patted Billa's shoulders soothingly, but nothing more.

"Chill man chill," Jug said.

Billa hit Happy with his free hand, a little gentler but still painful. The blow sent Happy veering wide on a left turn and into a light pole with the front right headlight and bumper. They took a tire over the curb before Happy got it together. Happy pulled the keys out of the ignition and got out of the car.

Billa got out his side and barrelran at him.

He was drunk enough that Happy sidestepped his blow and pushed him to the ground. He got on top of him with the ability to knock his teeth out but by the grace of God he restrained himself, knowing what would come for him later if he did. Jug was out of the car and tried to pull Happy off.

"Oh, know you got some balls. Who you with Jug?" Happy said.

He got up and saw Giselle beside the car.

"These two ain't getting the fuck back in. You should come with me," Happy said.

"No thank you," Giselle said immediately, not even flinching.

Happy unwrapped his car from the pole and drove off.
