In the end stairwell on the other side of the floor, he climbed until he got to the highest floor, the 18th. At the 17th floor landing he had to duck under construction tape to keep going. There was a open toolset and a ladder on the mid-floor landling. He was huffing.

The final landing was under construction due to a water leak in the ceiling, Amit stood there was Saad waiting.[^1] When Happy looked up, he saw the stucco crumbling. Semi-loose pieces were hugging the exposed rebar for dear life.

"You got the yayo," Amit said, doing an impression of Tony Montana from Scarface, which Amit had assigned him as homework viewing. When Amit and Saad were together without too many others around, they resembled pre-teens more. They giggled at each others' corny jokes, which reminded Happy that they were childhood friends.

"Yeah here," Happy said.

"Oh shit, you didn't get clapped for requesting two chickens?" Amit said.

"You fucked with him?" Saad said.

"Yeah I was trying to get the fucking nerd roughed up, he needs to get tough quick," Amit said.

Amit tore away the plastic roughly until the week ziplock sprouted out of it. 

"Alright he didn't rip you off, probably because he knew I was asking," Amit said.

Happy thought of Sleepy a greying man, being afraid of Amit, a 13 year old boy.

"The guy's not so bad you know, he's helping me chop Sweety," Saad said.

"Oh Sweety, you hot for her? She's fine," Amit said.

Saad's eyes narrowed.

"Yeah and she's gonna be mine, bro code and all that," Saad said.

"Arlight, no stress," Amit said.

Amit thought, looked at Happy and got his idea.

"Yo, you should slang this for me," Amit said[^2]

"Come on, leave the guy alone," Saad said.[^3]

"OK well try it first, it's good. Nihangs take pang all the time. It's the same thing," Amit said.

"They take pang and then get brave to fight battles. But if you need to get high to fight battles, are you brave?" Saad said.

"There goes you with that introspection shit," Amit said.

"I'll do it, but I don't wanna try it," Happy said.

Amit smiled.

"Fine by me fucker. You owe me $xx next week," Amit said, as he threw the weed at Happy to catch.

Amit told him to sell it a dime at a time. Amit pulled out his scale and showed him how to bag it so that each the scale read 0.9 as the baggie added 0.1. He showed him to mix a little sticks in to each baggie to beef up the weight.

Once he felt satisfied with his lesson, Amit handed him half the weed which he put in his backpack. He gave hime a quater oz out of his full oz. It had to make Happy 8 gram bags between pinching and mixing in a bit of dirt. Happy could sell that for $80. 

He owed Amit $70 and he could keep $10 for his efforts.[^5]

They heard walking coming up the stairs and froze.

"Yo, put this shit away, you trying to get us bagged?" Amit said.

Saad leaned over the middle opening that fell all the way down.

"Yo," Saad said, his voice echoing.

"Yay-yo," Jug responded, with faint clinking as his chorus.

Jug came up to their floor carrying a two-four of Lakeport Pilsner.

"Yo you fuck, you got the Pilsner," Amit said.

"What's wrong?" Jug said.

"You should've got the Honey Lager," Amit said.

"Why?"

"It takes way better and it's the same fucking price," Amit said

Lakeport was the dollar-a-beer brand the crew relied on to get a cheap buzz. 24 beers for 25 dollars rang out thru all the radio ads.

"Aight, but what you gonna do with all this weed and all this beer, we're gonna get zombied," Jug said.

"Don't worry about the weed, our boy here is going to slang what we don't smoke today," Saad said.

"Oh really? Big man," Jug said.

"Yeah so you gotta pay for the dime we're smoking," Saad said.

"Why me?" Jug said.

"Because you're the one who wants it bad. Amit and I are good either way," Saad said.

Jug begrudgingly pulled out the cash.

Saad slapped Happy's back.

"See bro, got you your first sale," Saad said.
