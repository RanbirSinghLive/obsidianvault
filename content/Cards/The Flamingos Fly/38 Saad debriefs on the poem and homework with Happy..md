Suddenly Saad walked over with a wide, forced grin, straight towards Happy.

"Yo Happy, did you give a poem to Dilmit too?" Saad said.

"Yes," Happy said.

"You don't think that's a bit bait?" Saad said.

"They're different poems," Happy said.

Saad grabbed his shoulder.

"Come on, you devil you. They showed them to each other. Next time do something different for her so it's not suspicious," Saad said.

Saad didn't seem upset. Sweety must've not mentioned anything as she'd stated.

"What did Sweety say?" Happy said.

"She smiled and said aww, I think this is gonna get me in good with her," Saad said.

Happy grabbed his things and walked away from the pulpit. This hadn't gone as planned by any stretch of the imagination.

"You going to the dance this weekend?" Saad said.

"Dilmit has been chatting about it, but I don't know," Hsppy said.

"What are you? Gay? Your girl wants to go and you're unsure? You could get a bubble off her bro," Saad said.

"Yeah for sure. She's on my dick," Happy said.

"Make sure you come. You're doing good to prove yourself to us, but if there's a scrap at the dance with the kalay we'll need numbers. Make sure you bring a blade," Saad said.

"OK, how are you getting there?" Happy said.

"I'm getting a ride from my older bro and I'm picking up Sweety as well. You should make sure you get a ride from your parents so you can pick her up as well. Not a good look to have your girl ride the rocket," Saad said.

Saad slapped Happy's back and left him alone to look forward to the dance.
