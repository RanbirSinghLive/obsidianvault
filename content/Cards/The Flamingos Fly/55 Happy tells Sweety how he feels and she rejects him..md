The homeroom was empty except for her when he walked in. It felt longer than a month ago when he'd walked in surprised to see her. Now he walked in with confidence. He was a badmon and was of use to her as a mate.

She sat at her usual chair, an hour prior to school starting. He'd asked her to come in early so they could study for the English mid-term together. She had sexy eyes. 

"Hey, thanks for coming early to study with me. I'm so behind I can't take it," Happy said.

"It's all good. I got your back. You need to straighten up before things get worse," Sweety said.

"Straighten up? I don't hear you saying that to Saad or Amit," Happy said.

Sweety spared his feelings and flipped open her copy of Lord of the Flies.

"OK, where did you get to?" Sweety said.

Happy paused.
 
"Well I started reading it but then I had to go to work," Happy said.

"Go to work? You can't let that impact your school studying," Sweety said.

"That's easy for you to say. You don't have a drunk dad who lost his job," Happy said.

"I'm sorry," Sweety said.

"You didn't know," Happy said.

Having the upperhand, he felt it was the right time.

"Do you want to go out with me?" Happy said, his voice getting quieter with each word until the last one squeeked out.

Sweety smiled and wasn't surprised. She closed the book and looking at him with intention.

"Happy, I think of you as a brother," Sweety said.

"OK it was just a joke," Happy said.

"You idiot. You just broke up with Dilmit and now you're doing this," Sweety said.

"Don't tell her," Happy said.

"She wouldn't care. I don't know what she'd expect from you. You really hurt her," Sweety said.

"Well if you're not gonna go out with me. you should know why I was shitty. It's because I really like you and wanted to go out with you," Happy said.

"So why did you lead her on? I'm going out with Amit by the way. It's a secret but fuck it. Maybe this way you're get your head screwed back on and stop fucking around," Sweety said.

"What about Saad?" Happy said. All this time he'd been blocking the wrong cock.

"Saad's a sweet brother but Amit's my man," Sweety said.

"If I were you I wouldn't go with either of them," Happy said. "They're both gangsters and will end up in trouble. You'll be left holding onto your love for them as they're dead, in jail or maimed. You're destined for great things. Don't tie your ballon to those bricks."

Sweety thought for a while.

"That's funny coming from someone who wants to be them so bad," Sweety said.

Happy thought about asking her for help, but couldn't bring himself to get any more emasculated in one sitting.

His lip quivered without his command. The worst thing is that he liked the idea of having a sister.[^1] It was better to get closer to her in any way he could. 

He was pathetic.
