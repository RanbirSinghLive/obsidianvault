Happy work up from his nap at Shera's place. The glow from high window at the merge with the ceiling gave away the morning. Shera was on the computer checking on the morning's forex rates as the London market had been open for half a day already. He could tell he hadn't showered yet. 

"When did you pass out?" Shera said.

"Right after you. I'm gonna make a call," Happy said.

Happy pulled out his phone and dialled Saad, who picked up on the 2nd ring.

"Yo let's do it," Happy said.

"Good. I got the stuff to pick up," Saad said.

Happy pulled into 777 and turned the car off as soon as he could. He pulled the keys out of the ignition and put them in his left pocket, which zipped up shut. Happy unlocked his door and reached over to pull open the lock tab on passenger's door as well. He stayed bent over and rolled down the window by the handle as well. 

As he finished rolling down the window he looked up to see Saad walking towards him with an electronic contraption. He got in and was straight to business.

"Here it is, it's meant to look just like a credit card pad, but it snaps onto the existing one. You just need to put it on the exact right way and customers won't notice it. Then when they pay their card goes through this first and it gets their details so we can create another card off it," Saad said.

"So I can go in whenever to put it on?" Happy said.

"Well yeah but best to do it late at night when there's no one around. When you go pick her up pop it on while she's changing," Saad said.
 
Happy held the machine and inspected it. There was the skimmer along with a couple of wires sticking out. The wires were fragile, so he pulled them off in a switft motion and thew the machine out the window. 

"What the fuck," Saad said, dumbstruck.

It didn't take long for him to wind up and stuck punching Happy in the face. It took everything in Happy now to fight back or shield his face.

He cried out in pain upon the first one, his head spinning. He turned to open the car door while Saad was still upon him in the back of his head.

When he got outside he saw the skimmer broken across the pavement and stepped on it to be sure it was broken.

He then came around the car to Saad's side, who was out of the car and lunging at him. Saad punched and Happy took one more to the face and his nose burst out in blood. 

"Is my blood enough?" Happy said at the top of his lungs.

The few folks walking around were taking notice. 

"Have I paid the price?" Happy said.

Happy screamed like a banshee, which starting gathering a crowd. Saad got aware and starting walking away, back to his building.

"You're dead," Saad said.

"Is it enough?" Happy said, falling to his knees.

"You're dead," Saad shouted.
