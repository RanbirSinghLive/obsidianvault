"Nah man, I'm trying to keep my nose clean," Odaine said.

"So I got this thing going on today with a customer. Can you cover for me?" Happy said.

"Cover for you how bro?" Odaine said.

"Just stay out of the way my man, that's all," Happy said.

"Alright," Odaine said.

"So what rap artist is your favourite?" Happy said.

"I like EPMD," Odaine said.

"Yeah, but what the fuck kind of criteria is that?" Odaine said.

"What else would you use?" Happy said.

"If the music is dope man," Odaine said.
