Happy walked home from Gobind's garage. It was 30 minutes along the highway but it gave him time to think. He just wanted to get home, wash up and reset for the week.

When he got home, his mum was seated at the dining table as usual.

"What happened to your face?" Mummi said.

"I got in a fight," Happy said.

"Hmph," Mummi grunted.

"You don't care?" Happy said.

"Well while you're worrying about getting into stupid flights, I'm worrying about your uncle," Mummi said.

Happy resented that.

"Oh ya, well I went to see him. How's your head, you feeling better?" Happy said mockingly.

"You know he's still paying rent on his apartment now that Jagpreet left? Who's going to pay for October now that she emptied all the accounts and left him with jackshit. She even took his wedding jewellery," Mummi said.

Happy wished he'd punched Babbu after all.

"I'm just trying to rest after a fucked up day before I get back to school, but this ain't a place I've ever been able to rest. I've hated it ever since we moved here," Happy said.

"I don't think you're hearing me. He can't afford to live there anymore, and we have no room here," Mummi said.

"So then what? He stays in jail? He goes homeless? We'll figure it out," Happy said

"You're not the one who's seen him decline mentally over your whole life. He used to hold down the house in India when Pinder was away. Now he hears people talking who aren't there. We don't have the resources to take care of him here. We're all trying to keep our own lives from going to shit," Mummi said.

"So then what?" Happy said, his throat starting to knot and hurt.

"Minder Uncle is going to have to go back to India to live with his brother," Mummi said.

"That's your answer? They don't even believe what he has is a real disease back home. They just think he's retarded or haunted. He won't get any help," Happy said.

"What does he get here? Just long wait times and medication. He'll have his language, good weather and no financial worry," Mummi said.

"I know he wants to stay here. We've talked about this. He'll want to stay here in case he can ever seen his son again. What does Pinder Uncle think about all this?" Happy said.

"He's the oldest son. He's got no choice. This is his burden to bear. He's also sitting on all out family land so he can figure it out I'm sure. What does your uncle have here anyway? He's got no friends, busts his hump and its not any better," Mummi said.

"But what does *he* want to do? His son is here. He may want to see him when he gets old enough. If he goes to India he's not coming back," Happy said.

"There's no choice," Mummi said.

"I won't let it happen," Happy said.
