Dilmit outstretched both arms and called Happy over, noticeable enough for the whole circle to see. Happy met her gaze momentarily, and then looked past her shoulder and kept clapping his hands together in unison with the beat. 

When he snuck a glance back, her cheeks were redder than their already blushed state. She had turned to Giselle and was clapping more assertively than ever before, our of anger and embarassment. Giselle had seen Happy's spurning with fidelity so she was eager to help get Giselle's mind off the snub.

The pantomime also brought Sweety'd attention. She looked at Happy furious.

"What the fuck?" she mouthed.

Another boy cut into the circle and started dancing some stilted bhangra. It was Ram. She slid in and started dancing in front of the girls one by one, ending with Dilmit and lingering in front of her. She initially refused him. 

*Good.* 

But Ram was persistent and she decided to start dancing with him. Their dancing was as tame as Saad's and Sweety's but it sent Happy fuming. Saad took a look at the mating dance and turned to Happy for instructions. Happy shook his head, waving Saad off, who shrugged and kept dancing.

Happy stepped out of the circle and didn't stop walking when he reached the front doors.
