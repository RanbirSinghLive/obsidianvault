The double doors opened again and Saad stepped out in a determined pace followed by Ram behind him in no less certain a stroll.

Happy thought that was it, but to his surprise the giddha circle had broken open and followed the two out, along with most of the the Gunz who'd come unglued from the back wall.

The murmurs of onlookers filled the night air that had been quiet only shortly before. Happy looked eyes with Dilmit, who looked fearful of what wrath had brought. The night air was more frigid than usual for a September evening and she shivered while Giselle rubbed her full back.

Happy tapped both heels on the pavement in alternating hits while the edges of his growing mustache hairs stiffened from the dewy exhale of his breath. Kids were filtering out one by one and two by two. 

His eyes were trained above Ram's forehead, unable to make eye contact. Ram didn't seem deterred from a confrontation, as he had an inch on Happy and was athletic from his soccer practise. 

It dawned on Happy that the desis hung out at the back because they all lived in that direction, and the same for the kalas out front. They'd all travelled or were made to travel thousands of miles to still live with the same types of people back home. [^1]

Saad stood on the side with Frick and Frack behind him. Happy was relieved to have them close

"Your boy said you wanted to talk. What do you want to talk about?" Ram said, loudly. He didn't seem bothered by the show.

"You fucking hitting on my girl in there. I thought we were boys" Happy said.

"We are not boys. You disrepected me and you're a fucking loser who does people's homework to make friends. And your girl told me she's thinking of breaking up with you. You don't even talk to her in public. You're a waste of air," Ram said.

Happy was overwhelemed. Everyone had watched him get eviscerated. Ram was backing himself into a corner willingly. Happy knew the Gunz wouldn't do anything without his tempo. He would have to make the first chess move like RZA would. 

In an awkward segway, Happy trotted closer to him with his fists up. This gave Ram ample time to square up in defense. Ram was fit, but not a killer, so he followed Happy's pace.

Happy swung and hit Ram's guard arm with hire forearm. He thought he'd missed but Ram's guard arms weren't tensed so his own fist hit his chin in a domino effect. This had the effect of stunning him enough to drop his guard for a moment.

Saad took this as his signal to jump in from the side and punch Ram square in the back of his head, dropping him to the floor. The fricks followed. Ram didn't stand a chance. 

They opened up enough space for Happy to deliver a kick. His aim had improved.

Once the damage was done, the gang scattered in three directions, holding their pants up as they ran.

The onlookers stood around, not in as much of a rush to run away. Happy was stunned and took a split second to recognize he should run as well. He looked up at Dilmit for validation and vindication. He looked up to see her looking at him with newfound disgust and turned away. 

Happy breathed heavily, wasting more air.
