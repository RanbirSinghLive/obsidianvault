"What the fuck was that?" Jug said.

"I didn't do anything, I was walking with Sweety and he snapped," Happy said.

"See that's the problem. You don't go around at the best friend of his sworn enemy parading around with his newly ex-girlfriend. You weren't doing nothing. You were doing the one thing that would turn his caveman brain on," Jug said.

They were standing at a side exit of the school, midway between the front and back. It was purposely midpolar to avoid the gaggles of racial groups and find a corner for their small crew to orbit around.

Happy looked to see Shera roaring into a small flipphone and then flipping it closed.

"I called Saad, he's on the way," Shera said.

"Great, that'll take him 2 bus companies and 3 buses to get here. He'll be here at midnight," Jug said.

"He says he's got a whip," Shera said.

That took both Jug and Happy by surprise. 

"How much luncy money we got?" Jug said.

Happy pulled a stack of 10's out of his pocket in a rubberband.

"It depends how much we want to eat. We don't have to settle for a bag of funions and a 2 liter of coke anymore boys, moving up. How about the asian buffet?" Happy said.

"So we're really skipping school?" Shera said.

"I can't believe you'd be the one to say that one day," Happy said.

"We gotta graduate bro. This shit is great but we need to not let it get us expelled. Also we are trying to be the best we can even though the Illuminati are after us," Shera said.

"Bro all that shit is stupid, you can't let it distract you," Happy said.

"We'll see about that bro. Something big's gonna happen next little while and we'll be having this chat again," Shera said.

Happy relished finally snapping Shera out of this funk when nothing happened.
