Happy was waiting in the parking lot, under the raincover when Jug pulled up. He pulled into the parking lot with too much speed so the suspension of the car crunched as he came closer.

Jug and Giselle were in the front seats so Happy dropped in the back. Big mistake.

"How was the night?" Happy said.

"Chillin," Jug said.

"Alright, how you doing Giselle?" Happy said.

The car pulled out of the parking lot and down the road towards Rexdale.

"Good, you?" Giselle said.

"Well alright, sounds like a quiet night for you two. I'm doing OK," Happy said.

"We gotta do a srop before we go home," Jug said.

"Can you drop me first please?" Giselle said?

Jug turned to her longer than Happy was conformtable with. He was visibly tipsy.

"Why the fuck do you always got to be difficult?" Jug said.

"Hey," Happy said.

"I'm sorry I'm just tired," Giselle said.

"You're always sorry but you still violate," Jug said.

"Leave her alone," Happy said.

"You think you got the asnwers? I'm of a mind to leave her on the side of the road like a hooker," Jug said.

"Alright pul over," Happy said.

"Nah we gotta make a stop," Jug said.

"Pull the fuck over," Happy said.

Jug gunned it down the road and Happy gripped the driver's seat in front of him.

"Almost there," Jug said, as he pulled into Martin Grove Mall and towards the Chinese man's patti shop. As soon as the car stopped Happy jumped out and pulled open Jug's door.

"Alright alright officer," Jug got out with his hands up, mocking him.

"What's up boys," Billa said.

He was standing outside the patty shop and walked over. Happy hadn't seen him since late last year when he'd stopped by to see Amit and had avoided them both clearly.

"What's up," Happy said guardedly.

"Can I hop a ride towards your place Jug?" Billa said.

"It's his car," Jug said.

"Oh, what do you think bud?" Billa said.

"Sure, gotta make it quick though," Happy said. He was wary but now that he was driving he just wanted it all to be over.

They hit the road.
