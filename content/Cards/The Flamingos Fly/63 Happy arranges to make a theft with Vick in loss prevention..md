Goal: Arrange Lick Conflict: Vick Disaster: Yes but slipping

"So when do you get him out?" Vick said.

"We've got the crown lawyer taking care of it. My aunt isn't pressing charges," Happy said

He could feel the pity bubbling and wasn't going to take any of it.

"How are things looking today?" Happy said.

"Busy. I've got to keep an eye on the loading dock for a shipment from the coast coming in. Otherwise it's a Saturday dog. Mad folks coming through," Vick said.

"Good. I've got a lick to hit," Happy said.

"Oh word? What's that?" Vick said.

"Garden shed. We've got a few in the back that are getting packed for fall already. My guy will probably pull up around 4, grey Caravan," Happy said.

"You gotta tell this guy not to put mud in his plates. That trick's super old and bait. He's gotta come in normal. That's the play," Vick said.

"Yeah he's been told. This thing costs like a grand and I'm getting 600 for it. There's 200 for each of us when I move it," Happy said.

"Alright, you got new hires today?" Vick said.

"Not me, boss. He just wants me to teach them inventory until he knows which ones he can have face customers without biting them," Happy said.
