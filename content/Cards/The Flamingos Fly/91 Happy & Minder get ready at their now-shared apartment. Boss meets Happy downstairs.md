Happy ate breakfast in the living room of Apt. 219 like he'd done throughout middle school. He has rigged up a page holder to keep his book propped open while he ate. It was currently keeping the 48 Laws of Power open as the honey nut cheerios got scooped out of the milk.

His bruises were healing well and on the verge of being unnoticeable, except the cut above his left eye from Saad's pinky ring.

It had been a month since he'd dropped out, but he felt free to read his choice of book instead, that was more applicable in the real world.

"Eat more slowly so you don't choke," Minder said.

He sat across from him. They were both in their work clothes, ready to go to the agency for the day's shift. He was lucky to be assigned to the same factory. Minder's attitude to work had gotten better since coming home from jail. He still had court dates to come, but one thing at a time. Minder looked happy at last.

Happy got up from the chair and put his booth on. They both grabbed their thermoses of hot chai and got out into the world.

At the bottom of the elevator, they said their byes for the day and gave each other a hug. Minder lifted his arm slightly and gave Happy a gentle pat on the back while keeping the embrace.

"You're a good boy," Minder said.

Minder left out the back while Happy stepped out the front door.

A black Jeep sat outside waiting for him. Boss was. in the front seat with sunglasses above the brim of his baseball cap.

"Get in dummy," Boss said.

"How is this going to work?" Happy said while getting in.

"We're going to go introduce you to the guys and tell them you're the day shift supervisor now. I'm sure they'll be suspicious but it'll blow over once they realize you're just a kid," Boss said.

"How hard's it gonna be to drive the trucks?" Happy said.

"If you can drive a forklift you can drive a truck," Saad said.

"Well it's fine unless someone's going to commandeer my forklift by force again," Happy said.

Boss stared for a moment before the diffused any tension with a laugh.

Boss turned the car on and put it into drive while gripping the steering wheel firmly.

He paused and put the car into park again. He turned to Happy.

"I have to ask one last time before we do this. Did you ever steal from the store?" Boss said.

"Never," Happy said.

Boss smiled with a renewed lightness.

"I knew you were better than that," he said.

And then they were off.
