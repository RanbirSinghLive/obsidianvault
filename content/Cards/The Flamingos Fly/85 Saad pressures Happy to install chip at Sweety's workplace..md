"How the fuck are we supposed to pay rent while Moose is in jail?" Saad said.

Happy didn't have the answers.

"I don't know, now we don't have the store anymore. But why did he come unannounced?" Happy said.

"You think you call the shots? I don't even call the shots. He does," Saad said.

"And now he's in a holding cell, but the store probably isn't going to press charges," Happy said.

"He was wanted for some other shit, so he's staying in for a while at least," Saad said.

"That sucks," Happy said.

"How did we get caught? Did someone snitch?" Saad said.

Happy thought about Odaine and his young kid and his desire to get on the straight path and stay out of trouble and how he'd tried to get him in on the flex for his own aims and with a view of how Odaine was in high school. If he gave his name to Saad he would end up with a couple of teeth knocked out. He didn't deserve that.

"I don't think anyone snitched. I think maybe Billa and them heard about the flex somehow and gave a tip. Moose coming in without a heads up probably didn't help," Happy said.

"Fucking Billa. Fucking Amit. Meanwhile they're running that sick hustle. We need to get into credit card scams. The Tamils are all over it. When I went to see Moose in holding he gave me the name of a guy who can get us a rig to mount on a store one," Saad said.

"Where are we going to find that? I didn't work the cashier at Canadian Tire and I got no experience," Happy said.

"Well we can use Sweety. You told me she works at HastyMart and now you two are talking right?" Saad said.

"But she's not involved anymore," Happy said.

"That's even better. She's expendable. She's not in Amit's orbit so we can use her without worrying about Amit finding out. She can be our hapless mule for a change. I'm sure she's done *mutha* for him plenty of times," Saad said.

"I don't know man..." Happy said.

"You got income coming in from your dad whereas I'm broke without Moose with 2 younger siblings and my mum to take care of," Saad said.

"She's an innocent," Happy said.

"If we do this right ain't nothing going to happen to her. And if it does, so what? She picked her side 3 years ago bro," Saad said.

Saad also saw Happy as expendable for his own aims, and this was becoming clear to Happy.

"I won't," Happy said.

"I don't think I'm giving you a choice bro. We're blood brothers, and if you don't you'll be out there alone in the cold with Amir, Billa and now Jug swimming likes sharks. You need me," Saad said.

Happy had 6 inches on Saad now, but Saad rolled deep and Happy couldn't handle a 20 vs 1.

"Alright, I'll let you know how it goes," Happy said.

"What you''re trying to peace out? Hell nah. We're going to tail the fucker Amit and see how he runs his credit card shit. Then we're going to keep following him again I can use this," Saad said.

Saad pulled Moose's gun from his outer jacket pocket and showed Happy.
