I work for an airline, which means I can take flights for practically free. This becomes a lifetime benefit if I retire in good standing after 25 years. I recently started year 13, so I'm halfway there.

This got me thinking about what kind of a life I could afford if I chose to retire at the ripe old age of 46.

A few factors I considered:

- the ages of my (potential) kids
- the age of my wife
- the size of my retirement nest egg

For fun, I put together an Excel chart (yes that counts as fun for me):

In 2035, I'll have $1.4 million in retirement funds. Not enough to be set for life, but enough to transition to a new, purely digital career that lets me travel for 6 months each year.

If my wife can take a sabbatical, or find similar employment, we're in business!

The kids will be old enough to enjoy travel and make memories. And they'll not be far off from semi-independence, giving my wife & me even more freedom.

So that's what I'm obsessing about this week. What's on your mind?
