When growing on Twitter, 1 new follower used to be my weekly goal.

Then it was just a building block towards the next goal - 100 followers.

Now I stand on the cusp of doubling to 200 followers, with each next 100 being my subsequent goal.

One day, each new follower will be too small a measure, and I'll measure the increments in 100s instead.

In compounding, what was once the goal, just becomes the measurement towards an exponentially larger goal.
