It is a combination public notebook & writing portfolio. It is also a method of [[Gamifying notetaking]].

Writing is public works for me because [[Vanity makes us act like who we should be.]]

It is constantly being worked on (read: tended, like a garden.) 

After all, [[A digital garden is a grand strategy.]]

Some rules:
1. [[Growing from seed is harder than growing from a starter]]
2. 

I work to keep every piece of writing evergreen and [[Evergreen notes have criteria to meet]]. But in the end, sometimes I need to [[Balance evergreen & trendy writing]].

There is no order by which to traverse these notes. [[Digital Gardening is like going on Wikipedia rabbit holes]]

Each journey you take is supposed to be different & surprising.

Happy exploring.
