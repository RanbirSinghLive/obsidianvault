Saad stepped off the bus at [[Finch & Martin Grove.]] Happy was waiting for him. Saad was smiling more than usual. Happy noticed he was carrying a black t-shirt crumpled up in his hand. Saad dapped him up.

"This is for you," said Saad. 

He handed over the t-shirt. Happy un-crumpled it and saw a ironed on face of [[Jay-Z ]]staring back at him.

Saad wrapped his arm around him and started walking. Happy was leashed into walking with him.

"I saw this and got it for you. I'm really happy today. I lost my virginity today bruh," said Saad.

"Oh, that's sick. So you got me this? How did it happen?" said Happy.

Saad let go of Happy's neck so they could cross the street. It was clear they were on their way to [[Albion Mall]] now.

"It was a girl from class. I chopped her and we went to the mall at lunch. She said we should go to the washroom together and then she sat on the sink," said Saad.

Happy was skeptical.
