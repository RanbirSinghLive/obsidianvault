Frontline employees are essential to the running of the world. If they want change, they have 2 paths: beat em or join em.

Beat em is the revolutionary path. Requires disengagement from current system.

Join em is the permissioned path. Requires complete buy-in to the current system.

Understand a business as a complex system, and you are intimately familiar with one level of the hierarchy.

The great eye-opener. Realizing your simple solutions to problems don't scale as you go higher in the org (station attendant > manpower planner)

There is no computable optimal solution to a complex problem.

Steps:
1. Pick the right organization (big, hires from below, well-reputed)
	1. If you're in the wrong one, often there is a lateral move possible to the right one
2. Give yourself runway (personal finance at your income level)
3. Win your game (the tactical game you are tasked with solving)
	1. strats to win - metrics, relationships, reliability
4. Learn on the side (skills that are transferrable upwards)
	1. could be community college, online diplomas, self-learning
	2. need to be able to communicate learnings well in interviews and apply them to test problems
5. Apply for promotions (interal & external)
6. Repeat for further growth
