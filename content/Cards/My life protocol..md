In tech, a protocol is a system of rules.

'Every man should have a code' is cliche advice that should be better adhered to.

In the end, don't overcomplicate it. [[Happy accidents steer a good life.]]

My life protocol in short:
1. Love My Family
2. Do Great Work
3. Art Then Business

h/t David Perell (3 Lines, 3 Words)

# Sub-Protocols:
1. [[Always follow the order of operations.]]
2. [[Let easier compounding be the tiebreaker.]]
