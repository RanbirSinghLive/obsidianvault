I'm a mid-30s writer living in Montreal, Canada.

[[I lived for 15 years in a one-bedroom apartment with my parents]] I grew up in Rexdale, Toronto, Canada as the child of Sikh immigrants. However, [[I wouldn't be Sikh if I weren't born to Sikh parents.]] I've also recently explored how [[Immigrants use leverage too.]]

My free time is spent writing, playing chess & watching educational YouTube videos.

In the 2010's I was [[Working 18-hour shifts to travel the world.]] You can read about my [[Around The World]] trip if you'd like.

I'm happily married, which is a good thing because [[Your soulmate is a singularity]]. Although that didn't stop me from [[Almost losing my house]].
