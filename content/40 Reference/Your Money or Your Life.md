**Questions to ask yourself:**
- do you have enough [[money]]?
- do you have enough family/friend time?
- do you end your workday drained?
- do you have to do the things you find worthwhile?
- would you view a lay-off as an opportunity?
- are you happy with what you've contributed to the world?
- does your career reflect your values?
- do you have a six month emergency fund?
- do all the pieces of your life fit together?

If any of these are a 'no' this program has room in your life.

- The goal - transform your relationship with money
	- this relationship ripples through the rest of your life
- your money and the rest of your life are irrevocably linked
- get off the [[hedonic treadmill]]
- as consumers, to 'consume' is defined as 'to use up, destroy' - remember that
- The traditional financial roadmap led to financial dependency
- Consumption as a source of betterment hits a wall, personally and for the planet
	- example of [[Emergence]]


**[[Financial Intelligence]]**
- knowing how much you've earned (lifetime) and what you have to show for it
- know the true definition of money, and what you are trading for it
	
**[[Financial Integrity]]**
- knowing the true impact of earning & spending on your loves ones and the planet
- knowing what is 'enough'

**[[Financial Independence]]**
- having enough recurring income to meet basic needs and comforts from something other than paid employment
- also being free of toxic finance beliefs
- **this does not equate with being rich**


**_Your Money or Your Life_**
- if you are getting mugged, you will immediately give your wallet instead of die
- A lot of us are not 'making a living' at work, as it adds fulfilling to our life. We are instead [[making a dying]]
- Studies show people's happiness does not correlate with making more money
- **We need to start quantifying what is 'enough'**

### The 9 Step Program

**Step 1: Making Peace With The Past**
- add up your lifetime gross earning
- list all your current assets and liabilitiies ('what do you have to show for it?')
- this creates your balance sheet
- Remember: **no shame, no blame**
- take stock of what you have, so you have a baseline to determine what is enough

**Step 2: Being In The Present — Tracking Your Life Energy**
- money is what we trade our [[life energy]] to get
- we have a finite amount of time here on earth, and we need to be careful how we spend our precious hours
- Related [[Time is a finite resource]]
- We easily spend at lease a quarter of our total time making money
- Calculate your [[real hourly wage]]
	- include commuting cost, costuming, decompression time
	- principle - if I didn't need a money earning job, would this cost (money or time) disappear from my life?
- This is a very basic, fundamental practice for any business — and [[you are a business]]
- Keep accounts of all money that comes and goes from your life
- Need to be conscious of how our life energy is being consumed
- Instead of focusing on your breath in [[meditation]] focus on your money

**Step 3: Where Is It All Going? (The Monthly Tabulation)**

- budgets don't work, just like diets don't
- both deal with symptoms and not the [[root cause]]
- create a monthly in/out chart with money and translated life energy

**Step 4: Three Questions That Will Transform Your Life**

- On your monthly totals for each spend category, ask three questions:
1.  Did I receive satisfaction in proportion to life energy spent?
2.  Is this spend of life energy aligned with values and life purpose?
3.  How might this spend change if I didn’t have to work for a living?

Grade things on a -1,+1 or 0 and come up with your life energy balance for the month

- **This is the core of the program**
- the goal is to clarify and align your financial activity with your overall life satisfaction
- this will lead you on the path to discovering your 'enough'
- you will separate your financial choces from consumerist pressures

**Step 5: Making Life Energy Visible**

- Put your monthly in/out on a combo line chart and put it in an everyday visible area
- The satisfaction of seeing the lines diverge will be palpable

**Step 6: Valuing Your Life Energy — Minimizing Spending**

- essentially, watch your spending
- use the three questions from step 4 to guide you

**Step 7: Valuing Your Life Energy — Maximizing Income**

- Respect the like energy you are putting into your job
- is your job worsening your life?
- our fulfillment comes from our lives, not our jobs
- There is nothing in your life that is more valuable than your time.
- Calculate your life remaining to put things into perspective
- break the link between who you are and what you do for work - frees you up to make more fulfilling choices

**Checklist: Think Before You Spend**
-   Don’t shop
-   Live within your means
-   Take care of what you have
-   Wear it out
-   Do it yourself
-   Anticipate your needs
-   Research value, quality, durability, and multiple use
-   Get it for less or used

**Step 8: Capital And The Crossover Point**

- Add a line on your chart to represent the average monthly passive income you are accruing
- At some point in the future it will cross over the total monthly expenses line. That is the **[[Crossover Point]]**
- at this point you will be financially independent
- **you will have 'enough'**

**Step 9: Managing Your Finances**

- learn about long-term income-producing investments
- this program uses GICs/government bonds and requires investments be 100% safe
- also wants 100% liquid
- must not fluctuate
- in the re-write, index funds and real estate are deemed ok

The 3 Pillars
- Capital - income producing assets
- Cushion - 6 month emergency fund
- Cache - any money over and above to do what you please with
