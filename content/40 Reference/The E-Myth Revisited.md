## The Cardinal Sins
- [[**Working *in* your business vs *on* your business**]] ^f211c8
- [[Being Good at Something Doesn’t Mean You Can Do it as a Business]]
- “If you are unwilling to change, your business will never be capable of giving you what you want.”
- [[The Entrepreneurial Seizure]]: Getting the crazy idea to start your own business

“Everybody who goes into business is actually three-people-in-one: The [[Entrepreneur]], The [[Manager]], and The [[Technician]].”
- The Technician is our base state that does our job well and has the Seizure.

## **The Entrepreneur**
- Lives in the future and thinks 'what-if?'
- looks for new markets or ways to enter existing ones
- Control freak. Needs control so he can be creative
- Needs control but ironically creates havoc instead
- Most people are problems in his way

## **The Manager**
- Lives in the past
- Is pragmatic and loves planning  
- Order freak. Favours status quo
- Looks for problems and cleans up the Entrepreneur's messes
- Tension between entrepreneur's vision and manager's pragmatism

## **The Technician**
- Lives in the present
- Loves doing the work, but only one thing at a time
- Thinking does not equal work for the technician
- everyone is in his way
- doesn't like 'the system'

## [[Running a Business]]

- They focus on [[what the owner wants vs what the business needs]]
- Businesses exist in 3 phases:  Infancy, Adolescence, and Maturity
- [[If your business can't work without you, you don't own a business, you have a job]]
- You are supposed to be a job creator, not a job hogger
- Critical moment: [[hiring your first employee]]

- It's not about the product, it' about how its delivered
- Your business shouldn't be your life, it should serve your life
- Work like your business is the flagship store of a chain of franchises
- Write [[SOPs]]
	- Should emphasize efficiency and effectivity
- Innovation: the pathway to establishing individuality and a customer base
- Quantification: analytics related to your innovation
- Orchestration: eliminating choice in the operation of your business
