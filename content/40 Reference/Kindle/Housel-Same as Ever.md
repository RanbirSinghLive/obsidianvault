## Highlights
Every current event—big or small—has parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings, and cousins. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=286) ^ref-30668

base predictions on how people behave rather than on specific events. Predicting what the world will look like fifty years from now is impossible. But predicting that people will still respond to greed, fear, opportunity, exploitation, risk, uncertainty, tribal affiliations, and social persuasion in the same way is a bet I’d take. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=292) ^ref-28529

have a wider imagination. No matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today, everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one’s thinking about. Events, like money, compound. And the central feature of compounding is that it’s never intuitive how big something can grow from a small beginning. — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=303) ^ref-23584

As financial advisor Carl Richards says, “Risk is what’s left over after you think you’ve thought of everything.” — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=328) ^ref-62917

I can promise you that will be the case going forward. The biggest risk and the most important news story of the next ten years will be something nobody is talking about today. — location: [358](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0C1685PDK&location=358) ^ref-60085
