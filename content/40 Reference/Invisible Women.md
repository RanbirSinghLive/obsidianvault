- [[bias]] against women is partially due to the gender data gap
- when we think that males and the needs or males are standard, we fail to think about women and their needs
- this causes suffering when skewed date is used for making policy and product decisions
- not only women suffer from this gap

### 1 – We are conditioned to see the male gender as the default and disregard or ignore the female experience.
- Emojis are allocated by Unicode
- Initially runners and police officers were male
- introduced gender in 2016
- [[the default is male]]
- [[representation skews male]] from statues to banknotes to textbooks. There are more statues of men called John than there are statues of all non-royal women put together in the UK!
- In UK grammar and language textbooks, the references to men is more than the references to women 3:1.

### 2 – Data focuses on male experience and ignore the experience of a female.
- snow removal for roads before sidewalks favours men as men are more likely to drive for their commute vs walk (women walk more)
- most full-time workers are men, while carers and part-time workers are overwhelmingly women
- leaving women out of the data set produces a [[gender data gap]] that benefits men

### 3 – Women are underprivileged by data that doesn’t consider the experience of a female.
- [[why are women's bathroom lines  longer]]
- public planning regulations often specify that venues assign the same bathroom space for both men and women. This seems okay on paper – however, if you dig a little deeper it's based on data that disregard women’s needs
- urinals take less space and increase flow
- women take children in more often
- more likely to menstruate (tampons etc.)
- pregnant women pee more often
- impact magnified in developing world where toilets are unsafe

### 4 – A lot of everyday objects like pianos to smartphones are created for men.
- averagely, men have bigger hands than women. Tools and devices are mostly created for male hand measurements
- pianos are better suited for male hand spans - inhibits equal opportunity
- smartphones designed for male hands

### 5 – Women’s health and safety are compromised when safety measures are centered on male bodies.
- In terms of health and safety, the word “standard” regularly signifies “standard male”; 
- suggested office temperature, which was fixed during the 1960s, centered on the metabolic resting rate of a 40-year-old, 70 kg male
- crash test dummies mostly male
- women’s bodies are not just proportionally and anatomically different from male bodies; however, they also possess different immune systems and hormones
- a lot of health and safety recommendations are centered on reference man. 

### 6 – Women’s health consequences are affected by data that specifically neglects the woman’s body.
- Men and male bodies are considered “standard” from infrastructure to design
- women are regularly neglected during medical trials. Why? According to a study that was conducted in the EU in 2017, women’s bodies were considered as very “difficult” and “costly”; their irregular hormones make them “difficult” subjects.
- In the US, the FDA saw that in trials for coronary stents, 32% of the participants were just female. While only 19% of women participants were used in trials of endovascular occlusion devices.

## 7 – The world’s major gender gap is observed in GDP, and the consequence is the economy suffering.
- the most major gender gap of all occurs on a global scale – in [[the way we measure GDP]] [[Gross domestic product]]
- GDP measures national output in terms of goods and services. Services that are normally done by women are domestic work, childcare, and eldercare. When this domestic and care work is not paid for, it isn’t factored into GDP. However, it has economic value
- It was reported by the World Bank in 2016 that Great Britain had a GDP of ￡2.7 trillion. The UK’s Office for National Statistics says that the number is about ￡3.9 trillion when unpaid work is included
- Hence, what’s preventing us from closing the current 27% gender gap in employment? Unpaid domestic and care work is a major factor. In Europe for instance, where there’s presently a 12% gender employment gap, 25% of studied women said that care work hinders them from joining the labor force. Just three percent of men said the same.

### 8 – Political systems marginalize women, and public policy suffers as a result of the gender data gap.
- a lot of people making high-level data-based choices are male
- In 2008, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley established that when a woman speaks in a stereotypically male setting – for instance like Wall Street– she is judged more negatively than a man who talks about the exact thing
- female politicians are more often the targets of gendered abuse than male politicians. In 2016, a global IPU report revealed that 66% of female politicians stated misogynistic abuse from male peers
