Notes on [[Paul Graham]]'s "How to Get Startup Ideas"

The best business ideas come from a founder's own experiences and are thus 'organic.'

Focus on a pain point in your life. The founder of Dropbox was annoyed by moving USB drives between computers.

Paul Graham: best way to get good startup ideas is to live in the future and design what is missing there.

Living in the future means being at the forefront of things, where things aren't evenly distributed. 

It's tough to determine what is a futuristic notion and what is simply a new niche.

Some inorganic [[heuristics]] to find an idea:
- What are some things you needed at your former job?
- Can you try to turn off your filter that makes you evade a hard journey?
- An under-appreciated customer segment
- ride a new wave
