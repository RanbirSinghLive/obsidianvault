- [[I don't have a typical day, nor do I want a typical day]]
- [[I don't want to read everything, I want to read the best 100 books over and over again]]
- books are the combined wisdom of all of humanity
- Naval reads 2 hours a day - puts him in top ~0.0001%
- Most people don't read an hour a day
- It doesn't matter what you do. Just do something every day
- The best things to read are the things that excite you everyday
- we bundle our habits as part of out identity
- is this habit serving you any more? Maybe it served you as a toddler, but not now
- Naval is trying to turn off his [[monkey mind]]
	- We're constantly having a conversation in our head
	- playing back movies of yesterday
	- actually very bad for your happiness
	- break the habit of uncontrolled thinking
	- an impossible problem, so needs to be guided by feeling
	- I want my sense of self to get smaller to be more in the moment
- doesn't like never and always - limiting yourself always makes you less happy
- me: [[never say never. never say forever]]
- why did he drink? - to stun himself into submission so he could be in social situations he only tolerated
- best habit is the daily workout
- So these these questions, the search for truth, these kinds of questions, they ultimately do have answers, but they have personal answers
- I believe that [[happiness]] is it's really a default state. It was there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life and we are highly judgmental survival and replication machines, we're constantly walking around thinking, I need this, I need that. Trapped in the web of desires and **happiness is that state. When nothing is missing and when nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and your mind stops running into the future or running into the past**
- I've also come to believe in the complete and utter [[insignificance of the self.]] And I think that helps a lot. Like, for example, if you thought you were the most important thing in the universe, then you have to bend the entire universe to your will, because if you're the most important thing in the universe, then how could it not conform to your desires? And if it doesn't conform to your desires, something's wrong. However, if you view yourself as bacteria, a. an amoeba or if you view all of your works as riding on water or building cattle and fed, that you have no expectation from how life should actually be. Life is just the way it is. And then you sort of accept that and you have no cause to be happy or unhappy because things almost don't apply. And what you're left with in that neutral state is not neutrality. I think people think, oh, that would be a very bland existence. No, this is the existence of little children live. And if you look at little children, on balance, they're generally pretty happy because they're really immersed into the environment at the moment without any thought of how it should be. Given their personal preferences and desires, so I think [[the neutral state is actually a perfection state]] 
- the ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present happy and actually, ironically, more effective
- What [[radical honesty]] just means that I want to be free. Part of being free means that I can say what I think and think what I say.  They're highly congruent and integrated. And it also means Richard Feynman famously said, you should never, ever fool anybody and you are the easiest person to fool. 
- I would combine radical honesty with an old rule that [[Warren Buffet]]t has, which is [[praise specifically, criticize generally]]
- The moment you have a child, it's this really weird thing, but it's sort of it answers the built-in meaning of life, purpose of life question. All of a sudden, the most important thing in the universe moves from being in your body and to being moving into the child's body so that that changes you and your values inherently become a lot less selfish
- all the real scorecards are internal
- only the individual transcends
- people looking for social affirmation in work are prioritizing that over internal work
- [[macroeconomics]] doesn't run falsifiable predictions so it becomes astrology
	- It's no better than astrology. In fact, it's probably even worse because less entertaining is more stress inducing.
- [[microeconomics]] and [[game theory]] are fundamental
	- I don't think you can be successful in business or even navigating through most of our modern capitalist society without an extremely good understanding of supply and demand and labour versus capital and game theory and tit for tat and those kinds of things
- macro < micro in all things i.e. philanthropy
	- don't try to change the world, change something specific for the better
- the only thing that exists is right now
- How Naval learns: sticks to the basics
- the returns in life are being outside of the herd
- the smartest people he knows started out as losers, so they were less invested in winning the social game and did what was optimal for self
- your goal in life is to find out the people who need you to find out the business that is the most, find the project and the art that can do the most because there's something out there just for you
- You cannot hide anything from yourself. And so your own failures are written within your psyche and they're obvious to you. And so if you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself. And the worst the worst outcome in this world is not having self esteem. And if you don't love yourself, who will? So I think that you just have to be very careful about doing things that you are fundamentally not going to be proud of because they will damage you. 
- true understanding is about [[algorithms]] about how things connect to each other
- Richard Feynman, very famously, if you go into his lecture pieces where his early physics lectures, he has one where he basically explains mathematics in three pages. He starts from no line counting, and then he goes all the way to precalculus and it just builds it up through an unbroken chain of logic. He doesn't rely on any definitions
- the really smart thinkers are clear thinkers
- if you can't rederive things from the basics, you are lost
- the smaller you make your [[ego]] the easier you can see reality
- related [[The Great Mental Models]] ego gets in the way of solving problems
- [[the fundamental delusion]] - looking outside yourself for anything
