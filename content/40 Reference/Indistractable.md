- Living the good life requires not only doing the _right_ things but also _not_ doing the things we know we’ll regret. Being indistractable is about understanding the real reasons [[why we do things against our best interests]]
- learn to channel master feelings of dissatisfaction to make things better
- to master [[internal triggers]], learn [[how to deal with discomfort]], observe urges and allow them to dissolve, and reimagine the trigger or task
- To make time for [[traction]], turn your values into time, schedule time for yourself and important relationships, and sync your calendar with stakeholders
- To hack back [[external triggers]], defend your focus, send fewer emails, get in and out of group chats at scheduled times, and turn off desktop and mobile notifications
- To prevent distractions with pacts, plan for when you’re likely to get distracted, make unwanted behaviors more difficult, and call yourself “indistractable.”


## Part 1: Master Internal Triggers

We can be indistractable by learning and adopting four key strategies:
1.  Mastering internal triggers; 
2.  Making time for traction;
3.  Hacking back external triggers
4.  Preventing distractions with pacts

- “Being indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do.”
- All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort
- If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we’re likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort
- However, you can’t call something a “distraction,” unless you know what it is distracting you _from_
- Being indistractable is about finding [[the root cause of distraction]], rather than blaming proximate causes
- Zoe Chance, a Professor of Yale University, escaped the pain of her impending divorce by racking up Striiv points on her pedometer
	- she ended up climbing 20,000 steps one night cuz she kept getting push notification to walk for more points
- To ensure our survival, we’re evolutionarily wired to feel easily dissatisfied. Without discontentment, we wouldn’t look for further benefits or advances

Four psychological factors make satisfaction temporary:
1.  Boredom;
2.  Negativity bias;
3.  Rumination
4.  Hedonic adaptation. 

- don't escape from discomfort through distraction
- learn to channel master feelings of dissatisfaction to make things better.
- Resisting an urge can, ironically, trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger
- We can manage distractions that originate from within by thinking differently about the trigger, the task, and our temperament
- by reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, such as an urge to google something, we can disarm it

The following four steps help handle intrusive thoughts:
1.  Look for the emotion preceding distraction;
2.  Write down the internal trigger;
3.  Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt
4.  Be cautious during liminal moments. 

- [[Liminal moments]] are transitions from one thing to another throughout our days

To reimagine your temperament:
1.  Avoiding believing willpower is limited;
2.  [[Labeling]] yourself as having self-control
3.  Practicing self-compassion.

## Part 2: Make Time for Traction
- To make traction, we need to examine how we spent our time
- we need to begin with our [[values]]
- “Our values,” writes Russ Harris, are “how we want to be, what we want to stand for, and how we want to relate to the world around us.”
- One effective way to make time for traction is through “[[timeboxing]]” which involves setting an “implementation intention.”
- Eyal recommends revising your schedule regularly but committing to it once it’s set
- Once you schedule time for yourself, synchronize your calendar with stakeholders to ensure they don’t distract you with superfluous tasks

## Part 3: Hack Back External Triggers
- Contrary to belief, external triggers aren’t always harmful
- Of each external trigger, ask: “Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it?” Does it lead to traction or distraction? If it’s the former, it serves you.
- “Time spent communicating should not come at the sacrifice of time spent concentrating,” 
- “Group chat is great for replacing in-person meetings but terrible if it becomes an all-day affair.”

To minimize mobile distractions, Eyal advises:
1.  Uninstalling the apps you no longer need
2.  Shifting where and when you use potentially distracting apps to your desktop instead of your phone;
3.  Moving any apps that may trigger mindless checking from your phone’s home screen
4.  Changing the notification settings for each app

- When reading online, save interesting content for later using an app like Pocket. Or, use “[[multichannel multitasking]],” like listening to articles while working out

## Part 4: Prevent Distraction with Pacts
- Precommitments keep you from feeling distracted by removing a future choice 
- **they should only be used after the other three indistractable strategies have already been applied.**

There are three kinds of precommitment you can use to keep yourself on track:
1.  Effort pact;
2.  Price pacts;
3.  Identity pacts.

- [[effort pact]]: prevents distraction by making unwanted behaviors difficult to do
- [[price pact:]] adds a cost to getting distracted. However, you need to be aware of the following three pitfalls:

1.  Price pacts aren’t good at changing behaviors with external triggers you can’t escape (e.g. nail biting);
2.  Price pacts should only be used for short tasks; and
3.  Entering a price pact is scary.

An[[ identity pact]] is a precommitment to a self-image. "[[I am a writer"]]
