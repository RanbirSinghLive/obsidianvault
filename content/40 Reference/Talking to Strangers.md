CHAPTER 1: LOOKING FOR THE RED FLAGS IN FIDEL CASTRO’S REVENGE
- [[red flag]] = small warning sign
-  As humans, we tend to try and see the good in others, we ignore the red flags and then deal with the consequences later
- [[Aldrich Ames]], a top-ranking U.S. agent whose double-crossing lead to the deaths of many un-dercover agents, was ignored because of his drunken lifestyle and his ability to appear loyal
- [[We assume that we know the truth about people]], but that’s rarely the case. We may see some warning signs, but we choose to ignore them because of [[our willingness to trust others]] and dismiss those signs as paranoia or coincidence.

CHAPTER 2: MORE RED FLAGS IN THE QUEEN OF CUBA
- [[Ana Montes]], however, had a reputation of being one of the best Latin Intelligence agents and when accounting for her mistakes, she seemed trustworthy so her excuses were accepted as the truth. Not only was she loved by everyone, her connections to Cuba truly seemed coincidental until 5 years later when Ana Montes is convicted of being a spy
- Where were the red flags? Well, taking phone calls during sensitive meetings surely doesn’t immediately correlate to being a spy. But those [[minor warning signs can be indicators of something more meaningful]]
- [[As humans, our default is to assume truth]]. We have a [[bias]] towards the truth, and we are bad at picking out liars. We need near certainty to finally change our minds about someone we’ve met

CHAPTER 3: WHY ARE WE MORE LIKELY TO IGNORE THE RED FLAGS?
- [[Neville Chamberlain]] made plans to meet with [[Adolf Hitler]] for fear they were on the brink of a world war
- During the meeting, however, Chamberlain noted that Hitler’s appearance seemed more of that of an artist, and when asked if he planned to take any land beyond Czechoslovakia, Hitler responded that he did not. Satisfied with his answer, Chamberlain returned to England and relayed his trust in Hitler
- mannerisms and social cues are something we rely on to base our decisions. We are impressed when people have a firm handshake, maintain eye contact, and speak well
- Looking at over half a million New York criminal cases, when compared to human judgement, the people let out on bail by the machine were 25% less likely to commit a crime and more likely to show up to court. Proving that a machine can make better judgments about a criminal than a bail judge
- humans are more likely to be fooled by a person’s manner and body language. 
- There were many leaders that never met Hitler and never trusted him, they never gave Hitler the chance to deceive them through a trustworthy manner and handshake
- Related: [[The Great Mental Models]] - distance from a problem can be a bonus instead of a deterrant

CHAPTER 4: HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE THAT NOTICE THE RED FLAGS
- only one person was confident enough to bring [[Bernie Madoff]] to the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
- For almost a decade, [[Harry Markopolos]] and his team of fraud investigators continuously brought the SEC proof of a 50 billion dollar scheme. Each time, they were ignored
- people chose to ignore suspicions and put their trust into someone that had a good reputation
- Markopolos is different from the rest of us. He doesn’t[[ default to the truth]]. He’s what is called a holy outcast, a type of person who is isolated from society because he is differ-ent
- Being isolated grants him access to the truth in a way others are not because he is not blind by the bias created by [[social constructs]]
- Markopolos is a [[skeptic]], and [[there are many disadvantages to being a constant skeptic]].
- One of those is that skeptics don’t gain many friends and they lack influence which is why Harry wasn’t taken seriously on 4 separate occasions. So while there are drawbacks in defaulting to the truth, there are also drawbacks to accessing the truth as well.

CHAPTER 5: CASE STUDY: THE BOY IN THE SHOWER
- [[Jerry Sandusky]] was accused of rape. Many people are quick to blame the school for staying quiet, but would we have behaved any differently?
- There was too much truth bias about Sandusky because of how people perceived Sandusky as a well-respected coach within the community
- Despite the dozens of witnesses and hundreds of victims, it still took years for [[Larry Nassar]] to be taken to trial
- This isn’t to say that people were trying to cover up the truth, it simply means that there was a bias towards the idea that nothing sexual was happening
- In fact, a majority of the parents were in the room while he assaulted their children and they simply believed Nassar was just being a good doctor


CHAPTER 6: THE FRIENDS FALLACY
- viewers can understand what’s going on during an episode of Friends with absolutely no sound. The audience knows exactly how the characters are feeling which creates a bond between audience and characters. However, real-life strangers are much more difficult to understand.
- An episode of Friends is transparent, and people today adopt this [[transparency]] in real-life scenarios, believing that a stranger can be transparent just by their facial expressions, but life is far different from an episode of Friends
- we believe that facial expressions create a shared culture. We think we know what people are thinking based on their facial expressions despite not knowing the other per-son’s background, or not even being able to speak the same language
- One study proved this facial expression theory by setting up a horror scenario where people were completely surprised by a variety of creepy scenarios. While most reported feeling shocked and assumed their faces expressed shock and awe, the reality is less than a fifth of the facial expressions were associated with shock
**- It’s almost impossible for us to make accurate judgments to be able to know and trust the strangers around us**

CHAPTER 7: A (SHORT) EXPLANATION OF THE [[AMANDA KNOX]] CASE
- [[How do you know when someone is lying?]]
- The police simply believed Amanda was transparent and that they could read her behavior. The lead investigator quoted saying that Amanda Knox’s guilt was evident in her goofy and offbeat behavior. 
- She wasn’t sad and wasn’t acting like her friends who were also grieving the death of Merideth. From showing affection with her boyfriend just moments after discovering her friend’s body to purchasing sexy underwear in the days following, Amanda acted guilty 


CHAPTER 8: CASE STUDY: THE FRATERNITY PARTY
- The case of [[Brock Turner]] and Emily Doe is certainly not an isolated incident and is a frequent occurrence among college campuses.
- Why are encounters like this so prevalent? To answer this, we need to look at how college students view [[sexual consent]]
- only 44% of women think that taking off your clothes equals consent compared to 50% of males that believe this
- 51% of women and 58% of men agree that just a nod equals consent
- Both men and women mostly agree that not saying “no” is not enough consent; however, this data only proves bthat sexual consent is ambiguous
- There are no set boundaries, and consent only gets into murkier territory when [[alcohol]] is added to the equation
- [[Alcohol doesn’t cause inhibition, but myopia]], which is a state where you lack imagination and can’t process anything beyond the immediate experience
- In other words, alcohol narrows your focus and pushes all other thoughts to the back of your head, including long-term consequences.
- This also means that people are not their true selves when under the influence. While society largely believes that alcohol brings out the person’s true personality, myopia proves that this is not true.
- schools should focus on teaching both, respect and drinking culture.

CHAPTER 9: THE CASE OF SANDRA BLAND
- Bland was in a peaceful neighborhood near a college campus in the middle of the after-noon, so why take the time to pull her over
- Simply put, Encina believed he could assume the truth about Bland’s character. Life isn’t an episode of Friends, so while Bland may have appeared agitated, she was more likely stressed than hiding something criminal
- Encina couldn’t read Bland, what he thought was transparency, was a misunderstanding.
- Encina made an assumption about a stranger, something that we do every day. Therefore, it’s important to remember that [[we cannot understand strangers, and we should stop assuming that we can]]
- In the case of Encina and Bland, Encina didn’t understand Bland and blamed Bland for his actions when in reality, he should also blame himself for making assumptions in thinking that he knew her character

CHAPTER 10: FINAL REVIEW
- [[Trust your gut]]. We hear this term all the time. We feel initial instincts as humans, and we are constantly told to trust them. And while all of this still holds true, Malcolm Gladwell has successfully proven that we as humans cannot understand strangers.
- we are incredibly bad at understanding strangers
- We have an intuition that, while helpful at times, also reflect prejudices and preconceptions about strangers that are most likely false. So while we think we may know a person based on their reputation and manner, we don’t actually have the capability to truly understand the strangers walking among us, or even the people that live around us
