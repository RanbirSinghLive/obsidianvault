# Day 1: Maximize Your Profile
1.  **A catchy moniker:** The Diversified Solopreneur (optional)

Pair that with a crisp, professional headshot, and create a banner that supports your bio. You can do that very easily using something like Canva.

# Day 1 to 30: Livestream Your Journey**

I see too many people on Twitter trying to be funny, witty, or clever. Does it work for a few accounts? Sure. Is it the best strategy for most people? Probably not. Twitter growth is **NOT** about sharing meaningless platitudes.

Instead, figure out what you’re obsessed with and bring people along on your journey. Think of Twitter as a live stream, where you’re sharing everything that you’re learning (educate) in real-time.

Here’s a simple framework to follow, that has worked well for me:

**AM1:** Tweet a simple 4 or 5-step tip that’s easy to implement.

**AM2:** Tweet an easily consumable, and helpful listicle.

**PM:** Ask a great question that you’d like answered.

I use a tool called **[Hypefury](https://hypefury.com/?via=justin14)**, which automatically retweets all of my posts 9 hours later for double engagement, and then automatically un-retweets them 24 hours later to keep my Twitter feed clean.

Keeping your feed clean is important so steer clear of politics, arguments, and irrelevant content.

# Day 31 to 60: Double Down On Your Best

  
After 30 days or so, you’ll have a collection of 90+ Tweets to look back on. Some of those Tweets will have resonated, while others will be duds. That’s perfectly normal.

Find the Tweets that resonated and double down by turning them into longer-form Tweet threads.

Since you’ve asked a question each day (the PM Tweet), you can also turn the answers into Tweet threads. This is a very simple way to get started.

I recommend doing 1-2 threads per week because they maximize your chances of getting attention from the right types of people. They have a much higher likelihood of catching fire and going a bit viral.

Here's an example of using the AM1 tweet from above and turning it into a thread:  
  
# Day 61 to 90: Build Your Ecosystem
  
You now have a well-designed profile, 60 days’ worth of content to analyze, and some new Twitter thread ideas.

If you’re resonating with the right people, you’ll likely have some new followers as well. This is a great time to set up a small network of like-minded people, on the same journey as you. (you can also do this on day one if you’d like)

I use a tool called **[BlackMagic.so](https://blackmagic.so/?aff=JUSTINSAAS_B537E54D)** which helps me organize a group of favorite follows, and interact with them easily each day. By supporting people who are relevant to me, I generally earn their support back.

You should be doing this as well. Here’s a [**simple video of how I use BlackMagic to maximize my network**](https://www.loom.com/share/7c956a1fb7ee47bca5964b9e5169619b).
