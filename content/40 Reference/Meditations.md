### 1. The Evil That Men Do Harms You Only if You Do Evil in Response
- do not be upset with the misdeeds of others and if they refuse to change, accept it
- don't be surprised by evil acts and evil people
- people are ignorant to good and evil sometimes when they act
- social animals, including humans, are meant to live in harmony
- good and bad people are of the same whole and meant to interact
- when you hurt one, you hurt the group (bee & hive metaphor)
- don't judge others before looking at your own flaws first
- focus on self improvement instead of judging others
- [[Mind your business]]


### 2. Fame and Desires are Not Worth Pursuing
- fame and praise are futile. We shouldn't care what others think after we die.
- there are no immortal actions
- Related [[Ozymandias]]
- beauty comes from things themselves, not what people say about them
- if you've done well and helped someone, why do you need a third thing too - praise?
- doing good is your purpose

### 3. The Universe is Change
- death is inevitable, but we only ever lose the present moment because that is all we ever have
- you don't 'lose more' by dying early
- the longest and shortest life will end the same and be finished for eternity
- live to fullest as death could happen at any time
- get your affairs in order so you can simply live well
- don't be afraid of change as nothing takes place without change
- you cannot walk through snow unless you change the terrain
- you cannot watch a movie without changing your knowledge of it


### 4. Problems are Created in the Mind
- [[how we perceive events is the source of unhappiness, not the events themselves]]
- if we don't let events make us into worse people, we are not truly harmed
- “Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you haven’t been.”
- 'what stands in the way becomes the way'
- let what impedes you empower you


### 5. Your Rational Mind is Your Greatest Asset
- our reasoning skills is what elevates us from animals
- our minds only experience suffering when we create a desire for a specific outcome in life
- “You have power over your mind – not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”


### Three Key Takeaways

1.  Your mind has great power
2.  People will do bad and we are only responsible for doing our own good
3.  Remember regularly that you will die soon and live to do good while you're here
