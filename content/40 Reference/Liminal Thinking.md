In a [[systems problem]], you are part of the system, and thus part of the problem. You need to realize this before looking for solutions.

If you ask 'how are you holding up?' to a subordinate, you're signaling what kind of answer you want.

- liminal thinking - “the art of creating change by understanding, shaping and reframing beliefs.” 
- Analogous to seeing something in a new light
- when this occurs, you are embracing the opportunity to grow, change and learn
- you can encourage these ‘breakthroughs’ more regularly if you adopt a new way of thinking and being
- the opportunities are always there, just often invisible to you. tune your mind to find them

## PART ONE: HOW BELIEFS SHAPE EVERYTHING

### Principle 1: Beliefs are models
- understand [[the difference between reality and a belief]]
- reality is fact, there's no denying it’s existence, whether or not you believe in it
- a belief is something you hold on an individual level, it’s in your own mind
- beliefs are a roadmap of the external reality
- **the reality is fact, and beliefs can be wrong**

- the obvious is not necessarily obvious. this is because any belief you hold is relative, and not entirely accurate
- It’s impossible to know the entirety of reality
- To practice liminal thinking, you need to understand that there are many things that may seem obvious to you, but these things are only obvious because of your past experiences and perspective
- Not everyone will see the things that you see as obvious, as obvious to them
- Liminal thinking involves learning how to acknowledge other people’s ‘obviouses’.

### Principle 2. You create beliefs
- our beliefs don't appear, they are built over time
- the obvious is not obvious, it is built. we band together in 'obvious teams' that compete over versions of reality
- 3 things make up the [[pyramid of beliefs]]
1.  Your experiences. Your perceived reality is formed and limited by them
2.  What you pay attention to.  You will not notice other things that are going on.
3.  Theories and judgements. Whatever you choose to focus on, you will be inclined to have theories about them and make your own judgements.

When you combine all three, you make a roadmap to navigate your life. It is essential for life as a human

- The pyramid reduces reality from infinite complexity to a small set of theories, which form the foundation on which we construct our beliefs
- In order to improve your liminal thinking, you need to increase your awareness of belief construction
- You also need to be aware that others beliefs are self-constructed too.

### Principle 3. Beliefs and a shared world
- a belief is a story you imagine
- beliefs function as 'x, then y' if you have a need, look for a solution
- a [[learning loop]] is something that aids our effectiveness
	- a cycle of needs, thoughts and actions are on a loop providing continuous feedback. From this loop, our behaviours and beliefs are established
	- Feeling a need is the beginning of the learning loop
		- This part of the loop is located at the bottom of the belief pyramid. Here you’ll experience things and focus on the things that will meet your needs
		- The needs you feel are transformed through theories and judgements, the needs eventually become your beliefs
		- Acting upon your beliefs will allow you to witness the results. You’ll then apply your own interpretation to your experience and continue the cycle.
		- Therefore, **beliefs cause behaviour**.
- A learning loop can encourage both good and bad habits and behaviours.
- Learning loops are the result of interactions and engagements between participants.

### Principle 4. Blind spots and beliefs
- [[blind spots]]
- beliefs are essential but limiting
- which is why liminal thinking is so critical as it allows you to acknowledge which beliefs are limiting you and encourages you to look for new opportunities and possibilities

### Principle 5. Beliefs defend themselves
- we work together to establish a ‘belief bubble’. 
- ensures that our current beliefs are protected and ignores the existence of different beliefs
- This becomes a shared map that we use on a daily basis
- these bubbles can be beneficial, allowing us to share beliefs and assumptions and co-exist
- Downsides: If the bubble has existed for too long, it’s likely that reality has advanced and the bubble has failed to keep up
	- encourages people to stay put and not to test new ideas
	- Within the bubble, all beliefs make total sense
	- likely to be protective of the bubble as it is absolute reality
- testing and validating new ideas is a critical component of liminal thinking
- these tests can be done on ideas that seem completely crazy
- But the willingness to explore new options is what liminal thinking is all about

### Principle 6. Beliefs and identity
- your beliefs are completely tied to your identity
- there are shallower beliefs, ones that are superficial and on the surface
- These are the beliefs that are easy to change
- But the ones tied to your identity are near impossible to change
- to change these, you essentially need to change the way you view yourself
- to practice liminal thinking,  you need to be courageous
- There will be times where you feel that your beliefs have been threatened
- It’s natural to feel like you need to defend your belief
- But **to think liminal, you need to face the fear, embrace the opportunity to be challenged and see what you discover**

## PART TWO: WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT

### Practice 1. Assume you are not objective
- the [[Johari Window]] : created by two psychologists aiming to better understand one’s self
	- Picture a building that has four rooms.
	- One room is open - ‘public you’. 
		- Everything in here is known by you, and others know it about you
	- The second room is hidden - ‘private you’. 
		- It’s the things that people don’t know about you, but you know about yourself. The things you choose to conceal from others.
	- The third room is unknown - ‘unknown you’.
		- This room contains the things that other people don’t know about you, and the things that you don’t even know about yourself yet.
		- The final room is called the blind spot
			- This room contains the things that other people know about you and can identify, but things that you do not know or recognise about yourself

- the blind spot is where the issues occur
- it’s often easy to identify issues in someone else, but hardest to see them within yourself. 

### Practice 2. Empty your cup
- you need to remove all of the theories, knowledge, assumptions, and preconceptions that you currently have
- this is all to aid in learning anything new
- View it as  a blank slate. in Zen practice, they call this the beginner’s mind
- you need to be curious, open and eager. You need to be looking for opportunities to learn and develop yourself further

### Practice 3. Create [[safe spaces]]
- Emotions are at the centre of our very being, as it’s important that our [[emotional needs]] are met.  when they are, people feel valued, they work harder and achieve more
- Someone who feels like they are in control will be able to contribute more and take initiative
- Someone who is facing emotional fears will not be in a position to work hard and grow
- someone riddled with fear is more likely to hide away, protect the information that they currently contain and not let anything new in
- This restricts growth, development, and happiness

- you need to acknowledge the role that emotions play in the creation of your beliefs
- Emotional needs are at the very centre of our beliefs that transform into habits and actions

### Practice 4. Triangulate and validate
- the reason we don’t see what else is out there is that our own heads are too jam-packed with the ‘obvious’. There’s no space to explore
- gather as many different theories and ideas as possible, the crazy ones and the ones that seem to contradict your obvious
- Gather these theories, but don’t hold on to them too tightly, the key is to have them without being attached to them
- When you can achieve this, you are in a better position to ask the right questions and seek validation, allowing you to uncover what is really going on around you, what the reality really is
- It’s important to consider different perspectives and points of view when you consider any idea or situation
- **Even though something may contradict what you currently think, it doesn’t mean it’s wrong** 
- Gray explains that when things don’t make total sense to you, the problem isn’t with the idea, it’s with you. You are missing something

### Practice 5. Questions and connections.
- you should aim to inquire as much about people as possible
- Aim to understand their hopes, dreams, fears, and frustrations
- you are uncovering the goals and needs of people in the system. The same system that you are in
- Doing this will uncover opportunities that you may never have considered.

### Practice 6. Disrupting your routine
- Humans are routined creatures, we thrive off doing the same thing day in, day out
- we spend too much time in ‘autopilot’ mode
- scenario: you are facing a difficult problem, something that seems unfixable
- He believes that solutions often lie in the disruption of routine
- If you start to do things differently, you’ll be freed to view the problem in a new light, you’ll likely realise the way to solve the problem or see that instead of a problem, it’s actually an opportunity

### Practice 7. Double loop learning.
- act as if in the here and the now, also known as double-loop learning
- the process is challenging your current beliefs, testing out new beliefs and getting yourself out of a rut
- He encourages you to test beliefs that you think are one, you might be surprised at the results.

> ”In the case of double-loop learning, you don’t have to believe a hypothesis in order to test it. All you have to do is act as if it were true and see what happens. Change is only possible in the here-and-now, and the way to create change is by acting in the here-and-now as if a different world existed. For example, act as if the world you want to create is already here.”

- [[double-loop learning]] is a fundamental part of testing new ideas, particularly those that you would usually ignore as they aren’t within your current bubble
- you don’t need to believe that something is true before you test it, you can have almost no faith in an idea and still test its validations

### Practice 8. Make sense with stories
- [[storytelling]]
- stories help you make sense of the world and the people within it
- Someone sharing a story is actually giving you a bit of an insight into their life experiences and their beliefs, particularly their beliefs about the specific experience
- Not only are you gaining important insight, but you are developing a relationship with someone, building rapport and moving towards being able to collaborate together
- It’s also an important aspect of relationship management
- People like to be heard, feel understood and feel important
- When you ask to hear a story from someone and give them your full attention, they immediately feel as if they are someone that matters to you

### Practice 9. Evolving
- evolve yourself and embracing change
- it is very common to be afraid of change, to feel like it’s constantly attacking us
- We feel as if we don’t have control over change and that scares us
- the importance of embracing change in order to open yourself up to fresh opportunities. If you don’t invite change into your life you’re leaving yourself no room to grow or develop.

> ” Liminal thinking is a way of navigating change by opening the door to ambiguity and uncertainty, recognising that there can be no real creation without some destruction, a kind of urban renewal program for the mind.”


### Action steps
-   Aim to understand that what may seem obvious to you, may not be to others
-   Remember that your own beliefs are made up of your past experiences
-   Be critical of your own beliefs and acknowledge which ones are limiting you
-   Learn to test ideas, even if they seem crazy to you or contradict everything you think you already know
-   Always consider other peoples points of view and perspectives when approaching a new idea
-   Learn not to be afraid of change, embrace the opportunity for new discoveries
