**1-Sentence-Summary:** explores the popularized concept of time management from a different point of view, by tapping into ancient knowledge from famous philosophers, researchers, and spiritual figures, rather than promoting the contemporary idea of high-level productivity and constant self-optimization.

Time is our most precious resource, yet many of us fail to realize it. Time’s scarcity is what makes it so valuable, yet time management is a skill that many find difficult to master. Truth be told, it’s actually much easier than you think because I’m not referring to managing your days more [productively](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-joy-of-missing-out-summary/), becoming a more optimized version of yourself every day, or improving efficiency by managing time correctly. 

In fact, [_Four Thousand Weeks_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks) aims to emphasize precisely the opposite of the hustler mentality. In a world focused on organizing their time to the last minute, optimizing their financial status at the cost of their life, and leveraging our resources to get the most out of them, we’ve forgotten how to actually live in the present and enjoy life. Moreover, the book will make you realize why it’s impossible to master your time and why you shouldn’t make it a priority anymore. 

## Lesson 1: **Humans didn’t care much about their days before time wasn’t considered such an important factor**

If we take a look at history, we can notice that people didn’t always observe time as we do today. Back in medieval times, people went on with their life thinking about daily struggles, how they have to work the land, take care of the animals, or about things they’ve heard in the village. However, time played its role as well, as they had to crop and harvest during a certain season, wake up before dawn, and finish up certain things before sunset.

However, people didn’t think about it the way we do today. They didn’t try to organize every day in advance or optimize their workflow constantly to save more time. **Due to the fact that religion helped spread the belief in the afterlife, people didn’t value their limited days on earth that much.** Frankly, this is both a good and a bad thing. Stress and anxiety were definitely lower back then, as people weren’t pressured by deadlines and limited hours.

Still, development happened at a much slower pace. But living in such a developed world today, are we feeling better about ourselves? Are we enjoying life more? Not really. The constant pressure of [managing our time better](https://fourminutebooks.com/do-what-matters-most-summary/) led us to forget about the end goal: enjoying life as it is. As such, the lesson here is to stop structuring everything in your life. Leave time for blank thoughts, white space, and unstructured time. Simply put, enjoy life, don’t spend all of it planning.

## Lesson 2: **Prioritizing and accepting procrastination can lead to enhanced productivity**

Let’s start by debunking a common myth: Everybody procrastinates. Yes, even the most successful online gurus, motivational speakers, and most definitely, [top performers](https://fourminutebooks.com/in-search-of-excellence-summary/) do so. Why? Because this is how we’re programmed to function. We cannot possibly perform at our highest parameters at all times. That’s why whenever we try to do so, we eventually end up becoming burnt out. 

**Not allowing unstructured time in your life and wanting to manage every day perfectly is an unhealthy approach to life, which you’ll have to ditch sooner or later.** Instead, try finding a balance between procrastination and productivity. How? By learning how to prioritize properly. When you rank your tasks from most to least important and take care of them accordingly, you’re much more likely to finish things.  

Moreover, allow yourself to procrastinate when your mind feels tired. After doing a task, give your brain a chance to wander and rest. This will help you get back to work fresher than before. However, the time allocated for procrastination is what makes the difference. So make sure to still go back to whatever you need to do in a timely manner. Lastly, never start more projects at once thinking you can multitask. Always get things [done step-by-step](https://fourminutebooks.com/work-less-finish-more-summary/) and allow yourself time to rest in between.

## Lesson 3: **When you have free time, spend it doing the things you love**

If you manage to prioritize your tasks properly, divide them into smaller chunks, and finish things faster this way, you’ll find yourself having some spare time on your hands. As high-functioning adults in today’s society, we tend to take on new projects whenever we find that our schedules get a bit loose. However, the author recommends slowing down and taking some time to rest and reset. 

The decline of leisure that started decades ago provoked a huge build-up in stress, frustration, and anxiety that the previous generation passed on to the future ones. As educated adults, it’s time for us to change that. First thing first, find a hobby that brings you pleasure. You might feel reticence in picking up activities that don’t bring financial benefits, but that’s only a reaction induced by your overachieving brain. 

**Therefore, you must find pleasure in being mediocre at something, having a hobby, or exploiting a passion.** Moreover, fill up the rest of your free time with quality moments spent with your family and friends. Again, there’s no need to look for profits in everything, but rather learn to relax. Contrary to popular belief, spending more time undertaking leisure activities will boost your productivity in the long run.
