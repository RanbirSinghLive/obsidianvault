[[Mental models]] and [[heuristics]], they are shortcuts, algorithms and personal ways of thinking about the world. Mental models can have to do personal relationships, they can have to do with business. They can really have to do with anything, and eventually over time, the amalgamation of all these life experiences shapes our decision making. I sat down with Levels Founder and CEO Sam Corcos to understand the mental models he uses every day. We talked about:

-   Why focusing on helping people is the best way to build a defensible moat
-   Mental models for prioritization
-   Strategies for seeing the forest for the trees
-   The innovators dilemma for successful companies
-   How much data is too much data
-   Designing for loud failures

## EPISODE TRANSCRIPT

 [[regret minimization framework,]] I found adding some more specificity in my case was helpful. My mental model was, would I be willing to commit the next five years of my life to this? And in five years, if this fails, would I look back on it and feel like I regretted the decision?

 [[bikeshedding]] - it was something like an economist was reviewing the transcripts of a city council meeting, where they were thinking about building a nuclear power plant in this town, which is a really big decision. And he noticed upon reviewing the transcript that some huge percentage of the time was spent discussing the location and the size and the color of the bike shed and nothing to do with whether or not they should build a nuclear power plant in the town. his theory is **that people tend to gravitate and latch onto the things that they understand**. nobody understood implications of a nuke power plant, but they do know that they like the colour green more than blue so they latch on

Model for [[Startups]] priorities -  when you’re a startup, you are [[default dead]], you are not [[default alive]]. If things go on their current path, your company will die so you have to ruthlessly prioritize what decisions you make. when you get stuck on a problem, take a step back and say, “All right, is this what kills the company?” And if  no, well, we’re just going to have to accept that 10% of our customers are not happy with this decision and move on. **We need to prioritize the things that get us to default alive.**

**I think in the long run we’re all dead**. All companies die eventually. When I think about default alive versus default dead, default alive means you can start to take bigger risks with longer time horizons. When you’re default dead, you are prioritizing tomorrow. Related [[The Infinite Game]]

**From most large companies, loss aversion, overtakes that new ability to take big risks.** 

So early on, it’s really easy to double in size and have exponential team growth because one to two, two to four and extrapolate that until you’re at large numbers

larger companies build castles (success) and then build [[moats]] to keep competition out, but also locks them in. Focus on defensibility vs moats

This is something that really informed the idea of moat building as a metaphor, is you can’t really conquer the [[Mongols]] because they don’t have castles, they are they’re nomadic. They’re always on the move. They’re constantly adapting. They’re constantly innovating. The Mongols were really one of the first civilizations to create seige weaponry.

[[data driven vs data informed]]. it can also be very dangerous if you look at data and only data and you say, “Well, the data says it.”

Ben Grynol: So if I ask one of my kids what they want for breakfast and they say chocolate bar 10 times out of 10-

Sam Corcos: Of course they would.

Ben Grynol: … the data will tell me chocolate bar and if I rely on that, because my mental model is. data is the winner, then I am doing a disservice to them, to myself. And so there are all these opportunities where mental models can lead you down a bad path if you rely on them too heavily

It’s a question of when to trust one’s intuition. 

Ben Grynol: I know it’s something that you think through often, whether it’s strategy related to the company or strategy related to people or culture or you name it but I think [[Bayesian]] updating is an underserved model, not just a mental model, just a model in general, for the way that people navigate the world.

John Maynard Keynes, he made an assumption and he was incorrect and somebody pointed out like, “Well, you were incorrect and you’re foot flopping and you’re changing your opinions.” And he said, “When the facts change, I change my opinions. What do you do sir?” 

[[The Longevity Economy]] he calls it longevity because longevity has less stigma than aging. Nobody wants to age, but longevity is a thing that people can get behind.
i.e. just making the font size of an iphone bigger vs giant buttons - less humiliating option for seniors. Seniors are not children.

[[customer focused vs competitor focused]]  - focusing on who your customers are and what they’re needs are is such a better use of time than trying to mimic what other people are doing

[[Sunk cost]] I think is tied into that somewhat where it’s really hard, this is a, I think a saying that’s much more common in writing, is to [[kill your darlings]]. When you’re writing and there’s a character that you really like in your story, but nobody else likes them, you got to kill it and you got to move on

That’s the [[Y Combinator]] mantra, build something people want. It’s like, how do you know people want it? Well, go talk to people. 

Coming to terms with one’s own death and mortality is uncomfortable for a lot of people, but it is the reality. And when you realize that spending 10 years working on something that you don’t care about, and then you look back and say, “**Wow, that was a third of all of the work I will do in my life was spent doing something that I hate.**”

Test: Is This Interesting? If yes, do it. If no, don't do it. That's a way to never work again.

[[Malcolm Gladwell]] talks about this for himself as well. He’ll go on ski vacations with friends and sit in the lodge and just write. And his friend say, “Are you ruining your vacation? You’re just working the whole time.” “This is what I like doing. This is fun for me. This is my ideal vacation right now.”

can’t really control output metrics, but you can control input metrics so you should focus on the things that you can control

velocity is a speed at which you make decisions and shipping is the number of decisions you make

Don't debate too much about 1 or 2 week bets. Try it and see.

Most bets are [[two-way doors]] 

Instead of [[product-market fit]] it should be called [[market-product fit]]:
It is way harder to do market discovery than it is to build a product. It also is way less fun to do market discovery. Building a product is really fun. You get to build something, you have an app that’s in your hands, you can play with it. It’s super not fun getting rejected constantly by people which probably means that’s the thing that you should be doing.

 startups are complex adaptive systems. One thing that’s just really important to keep in mind is that things are going to change. Creating structures that work right now are not going to work in six months or in a year and that’s okay. You should not be building systems for a 10,000 person company when you’re 30 people

 the rule of thumb is that basically every time your company doubles, all of your systems need to be revisited. The difference between 12 people and 24 people or 24 people and 50 people is massively different. It’s largely because of internal comms, the number of people versus the edges between those nodes, the communication pathways, **your head count scales linearly and the communication pathways scale polynomially**

it’s not a bad thing that this happened it’s actually just mathematically expected that you’re going to have these problems

You want [[loud failures vs silent failures]]. If you assign responsibility to somebody and then the project fails, you at least know why and you have somebody to talk to. The responsibility is not spread across departments, it’s one specific person that you can talk to and understand what happened

It can become a [[Tragedy of Commons]] problem. We’ll use the boat analogy, if nobody is tasked with plugging holes, it’s the boat’s responsibility and then everyone just kind of stands by and waits for somebody to do it. And then the ship continues to sink and then at some point, the captain realizes that they’re halfway underwater and he’s like, “Well, why didn’t anyone do this?” Like, “Well, it wasn’t my job.” But if you have one person, let’s say it’s you, say, “Ben, your job is to plug holes.” And maybe it’s a huge hole and you don’t have the capacity to fill it, you’re going to go to the captain and like, and you’re going to shake him and say, “Hey, we have a real problem here. We need to fill this hole.”

[[one-way vs two-way door]] analogy 

 is a [[marketplace]] geographically constrained or not? Yes or no. It’s like if geographically constrained, density, if not, you can focus on going wide, but being long tail. So like stock X is a good example where there isn’t geographic density required to actually make it work because you are in a vertical where it’s just sneaker nerds and they can be located anywhere in Idaho or Washington, no one cares where they’re getting their sneakers from, whereas Uber or Skip or you name it, those marketplaces only work on geographic constraints and density and without density, you’re dead.

Yeah. I’m a believer in the [[1000 true fans]] analogy [[Kevin Kelly]]
