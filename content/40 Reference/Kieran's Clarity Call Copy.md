Attention, writers:

# Give me 60 minutes and I'll give you theÂ clarity and directionÂ you need to succeed.

**If you want to be a writer, build an audience and get paid to write words online, this will only take a few moments to read.**

**Right now, a lot of people want to make a living writing.**But after 25 months online I've noticed an uncomfortable trend:Not many make it.Seriously. Over half the people I started with have quit... which is a shame because the digital age is your best shot at doing work you love.I'm grateful to say I've helped hundreds of writers in the past year. And when we speak, itâ€™s usually the same 3-4 issues that stop them getting paid.Issues you can avoid with a few simple decisions.I'll tell you about them in just a moment.But first, hereâ€™s the truth:**If youâ€™re struggling to go from aspiring writer to making money doing what you love, itâ€™s not your fault.**For a long time, I couldn't cross the divide either.Why?Well...Thereâ€™s a lot of conflicting advice out there. And to be frank, a lot of crap advice too.

## Becoming a writer doesn't need to be as complicated as we make it

**If you donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m Kieran.**2 years ago I discovered this whole creator economy gig.And like many people, I was blown away.Because Iâ€™ll be honest, I thought 'doing what you loveâ€™ for work was just shit youâ€™re force fed on Instagram.But I stumbled across Twitter and heard of this little thing called â€˜copywritingâ€™.

---

_(yep, I thought it was just copyrighting like the rest of us)._And I was both excited and overwhelmed.Seeâ€¦At the time, I was a dentist working 50 hours a week in a rat race I couldnâ€™t remember signing up for.I was anxious 24/7. Stressed. Rarely present with my girlfriend.And maybe you can relateâ€¦

## I hate the idea that work is 'just something to tolerate'

And I know what youâ€™re probably thinking._â€˜A dentist? It canâ€™t be that bad. My dentist drives a Porsche and plays golf.â€™_(I drive the same car I bought after university and I can't hit anything with a ball).But youâ€™re right. Things could've been a lot worse. Although I'm a firm believer you shouldn't settle for a career you're not obsessed about.Like you, I want to make a difference with a skill I love.I wanted to escape the 9-5.**I wanted freedom.**But the trouble was I had no clue how. You see, the best part about the digital world is also the worst. Thereâ€™re so many options itâ€™s difficult to decide which is the best for you.The result is you end up constantly overthinking when you should be taking advantage of the opportunity.

## And maybe you find yourself doing this too...

-   Wondering what the hell your niche is
    
-   Worrying about how to build your audience
    
-   Doubting you'll ever find your 'unique angle'
    
-   Feeling nervous about the idea of getting paid to write
    
-   Wishing your first client would just land on your lap and put you out of your misery
    

I canâ€™t tell you how many hours of podcasts I ground through hoping for that little snippet of specific advice.Or how many courses I bought searching for answers.I didnâ€™t understand why I was struggling so much. Especially when most people on Twitter made it look easy.

## I felt like a failure.

And if you find yourself trapped in this loop, please take my advice:**You donâ€™t need to overthink it.**You need to make a few good, well-informed decisions.And then you need to act.I wish I could slap past Kieran in the face with that statement, but Iâ€™m going to have to settle for slapping you instead.ðŸ‘‹Â _Slap_Sorry. Needed to be done.Anyway...**Uncertainty will destroy you online.**You have so many options that you end up like a deer in the headlights.But really, there're only 3 important decisions to make.I found this out just over a year ago when I spoke to Dan Koe.If you don't know him, he's a writerÂ **who's built a 7 figure business around his brand.**We hopped on a call, and those 45 minutes helped me make more progress than the hundreds of hours of planning and 'research' from the previous year._Then suddenly everything was super easy and now I write 15 minute emails and collect money whilst eating cereal in my PJs._Just kidding.Iâ€™m not that guy.I donâ€™t want to trick you into thinking anything worthwhile is easy (Iâ€™ve fallen for it too, donâ€™t worry).But what I will tell you is this:

## Speaking to the right person when you're wrestling with doubt and uncertainty is one of the smartest moves you can make.

**Because being pulled in multiple directions is a sure way to guarantee you go nowhere.**It costs months, if not years, of energy, focus and progress.And since making those 3 decisions, I've built my brand to 37,000 followers on Twitter.

![](https://clarity.kierandrew.com/assets/images/image02.jpg?v=d25554cc)

Iâ€™ve launched a product that crossed $10,000 in the past 3 months.

![](https://clarity.kierandrew.com/assets/images/image18.jpg?v=d25554cc)

I released a community. Iâ€™ve started coaching and consulting.I spend every day writing and helping people.I donâ€™t drill teeth. I donâ€™t commute. No one tells me what to do or what to wear (except my girlfriend).

![](https://clarity.kierandrew.com/assets/images/image01.jpg?v=d25554cc)

And trust me:It doesnâ€™t feel real.I canâ€™t explain how fortunate I feel to be sipping my 4th cup of tea before 7am writing this to you (Iâ€™m British).

# 3 ideas that will help you succeed online

---

Now, you might be thinking, 'one conversation with Dan didn't magically get you to where you are'.And youâ€™re right.I actually invested over $3000 to really pick Danâ€™s ear._(Luckily, I can share all the good bits with you)._**But it was the catalyst.**Here're the 3 decisions you need to make to succeed as a writer:

1. If you want to get paid to write but you're not very good at writing, upskilling is the only priority

Not chasing clients.Because it doesnâ€™t take much to get into the top 10% (which is where the money is), but you canâ€™t get there if youâ€™re spending all day in the in DMs.Instead, spend a few months studying and practicing with intention._And that's studying copywriting._The best part is you can build a portfolio at the same time so you have something to show for your work.

2. If you want to make money coaching, you can do it sooner than you think

You don't need to be an expert to have knowledge worth selling.But you do need authority.And that means focusing on value, not virality.It means writing good threads and useful emails.It means reaching out and helping people.Because the more people you make successful, the more successful youâ€™ll become.

3. If you want to find clients, you need to niche down

No one wants a generalist.No one will pay you if you're sending DM's like..._"Hey can I write emails or sales pages for you."_You need to decide which type of copy plays to your strengths and then work out which industry to target.When it comes to sales, specificity is the secret.And most importantlyâ€¦If you want to become a writerâ€¦

## Get absolutely clear on your next step

Which is where I can help.**If youâ€™re someone whoâ€™s passionate about writing but feels like they canâ€™t get momentum due to uncertainty, fear of failure, or lack of confidence...**Then Iâ€™d like to help you get to where I am.And to do that, I'm inviting you to hop on a call with me where you'll learn:

-   What niche to shoot for that plays to your strengths
    
-   **The exact process Iâ€™ve used to go from zero skill as copywriter to building an audience of ~38,500, an email list of 4,700, and launching my business**
    
-   How to get crystal clear on who you serve so you can position yourself as an authorityâ€¦ and make money by solving simple problems
    
-   **How to find your first client without overcomplicating and overthinking the processâ€¦ including where to look (where most people arenâ€™t)**
    
-   The next steps YOU need to take to make your writing dream a realityâ€¦ instead of just getting the same old generic advice
    
-   **How to destroy your shiny object syndrome with personalised, in depth feedback**
    
-   An action plan for the next 3, 6 & 12 months to make sure you dominate the next year
    

And look.I rarely do 1-1 consulting calls.But I've realised sometimes, the biggest impact comes from sitting with someone who genuinely listens and is willing to give honest, direct advice.Sound like something you'd like?Cool.Hereâ€™s the process:

---

---

## Step 1:

## Fill out a future planning form

I don't want to waste your time. So before we speak, you'll fill out a questionnaire where we dive into what you're struggling with and what you want to achieve.This means that when we speak, we can dive into the good stuff.

Youâ€™ll speak to me, in-depth, to go through your plans and get clear on what you need to do nextâ€¦Weâ€™ll cover everything you want (and need) to know about writing and online business.

---

---

## Step 2:

## A 1-1 Clarity Call

---

---

## Step 3:

## Continue Communication

You'll have a few questions as you take your next steps.And I disagree with Marketers who charge for more advice when they've promised to help.So, my DMs are open as you make progress. Iâ€™ll give you pointers if and when you need them.

"When I launched my first digital product, I hopped on a few calls with Kieran. He helped me write all of my copy, gave feedback on the product and we nailed down a launch strategy together.Â **He went above and beyond to make sure things went well.**Â He knows his stuff and more importantly, he's super helpful."

"Kieran is the most friendly and knowledgable chap out there. We met on a cohort course and I ended up getting 10x the value from chatting to him than I did with the program!I was struggling with my niche and didn't know who I helped online. He helped me get clear on both. What's more, I wrote a thread that got 7000 followers over night after chatting to Kieran.Â **Every time I came off a call with him I felt like I knew precisely what steps come next.**I'm now launching my coaching offer and Kieran is such a good motivator for this as well.

"I had no clue how to write. Especially for Twitter. I met Kieran at 200 followers and the advice he gave me for free was worth more than everything I bought. So when I paid for some calls the return on investment has been insane.I grew to 6000 followers over 5 months with his coaching. He helped me decide what to write about and how to write in a way that builds the right kind of audience.Â **His advice and attitude toward success is so refreshing and inspiring that I recommend him to anyone I speak to**."

"I do a lot of writing as a one-person online business. I reached out to Kieran to talk about strategies for content creation and to tune-up my writing chops.**After the call, I walked away with a number of actionable ideas for how to produce better content and optimize my writing for business growth and authority.**You can tell when someone is talking from experience and when they are regurgitating what they read in a book. I know Kieran is out there putting in the reps and offering up what he has learned along the way. I am having an easier time coming up with content ideas after implementing the strategies he shared with me and as I continue forward I anticipate further growth for my business."

Dr Paul Fitzgerald

digital cohort course creator

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

After subscribing and reading his newsletter, I decided to booked a call with Kieran.His suggestions were clear, practical, actionable and his style of writing was refreshingly honest. After following him on Twitter and reading past posts, it seemed that â€œThis guy could help me!â€™I came away from the call with a deeper understanding of the key elements to creating both a more effective presence on Twitter as well as a path to more effective market my online course and offer digital products.There are so many voices offering help in social media writing that it can become confusing.Â **Kieranâ€™s approach is refreshingly direct and without hype of overpromising quick success.**I unhesitatingly recommend booking a call with him.

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…

I connected with Kieran a few months ago when I was starting to write on Twitter.I had no clue what I was doing.I wasnâ€™t sure what to write about.I didnâ€™t know anything about crafting a hook, organizing a thread, using psychology to get people to read my writing, and gaining the confidence to hit publish.After working with BIG K, Iâ€™ve learned so much about writing online and how to create compelling tweets and threads that others want to read and engage with.**Iâ€™ve grown from just a few followers to over 10K in a matter of months, and now the world is opening up to me as more people want to connect with me and share new opportunities.**Iâ€™m living my dream writing about what Iâ€™m passionate about.Many opportunities are coming my way and Kieranâ€™s guidance and expertise has played a big role in my current success.

Iâ€™ll be honest with you, this offer isnâ€™t for everyone.It's an uncomfortable truth but most people fail online because they aren't willing to do the work.And no call will change that.Because whilst my aim is to save you considerable effort and accelerate your progress, advice is only one part of the equation.**YouÂ are the other.**And a lot of people won't put in the reps.But if you're someone who will, then great, here're the details:

## There're only a limited number of spots available

... because the calls are time-intensive and I want to make sure you get the best value from your investment.And when we speak you can be sure the advice is solid. I've spent thousands of dollars & hours on my journey so far to learn the ropes.In fact, my last 3 clients paid $500-600 for a 60-minute call to critique their copy (trust me, writing gets pretty lucrative if you keep at it).But it wonâ€™t cost you anything near that.**You can grab everything weâ€™ve spoken about for just $399.**And if you appreciate how important the right advice at the right time can be, then youâ€™ll know this is a solid investment.

When you click that link you'll be taken to an order page. Then, after you've submitted your payment, you'll instantly receive an email with the questionnaire and an invite to book your call at your convenience.And if youâ€™re worried that you might not get value from this investment, I get it.There're a lot of shady people out there who don't really care about you winning. Just you paying.Hopefully youâ€™ve seen the feedback from some people who have spoken with me alreadyâ€¦ and that Iâ€™m not interested in making a quick buck from you.But if, for any reason I decide that I canâ€™t completely overdeliver or you believe youâ€™re not getting a great bang for your buck,Â **Iâ€™ll happily refund the cost.**No questions asked. No hassle. No risk that you waste your money.

What's more, when you book in for the call, you'll get a bonus gift:

## The Viral Inspiration Lab... Completely Free

This is one of the best writing resources on Twitter (trust me, I checked).Just aÂ _few_Â of the resources inside include:

-   **Over 1,400 viral tweets and threads organised into a database so you have infinite inspiration for extremely engaging content**
    
-   A video course 'Thread Writing 101', which teaches you how to 2x, 5x, or even 10x your growth by writing high quality threads
    
-   **A video course on how to unlock your inner creativity and create your 'Niche of One' using audience feedback**
    
-   A recording of a group coaching session on 'Powerful Digital Storytelling' to help you tell stories online that your audience love.
    
-   **ANOTHER group coaching session breaking down how to build your most powerful asset as a writer: Your email list. Including newsletters, lead magnets and landing pages.**
    

I won't put any more details about this because this page is already getting a bit long, but I can assure you that this product alone will make it 100x easier to kill it on Twitter.I use it every day and the feedback fromÂ **199 other writers who have purchased it has been great.**What's more, the price is doubling in 5-6 weeks time.

By the way, youÂ _can_Â just figure this stuff out on your own.Information is out there if youâ€™ve got the time to look and the energy to test.But you probably already know that.In fact, if youâ€™re still reading this, chances are youâ€™ve invested considerable time and money.And if you resonate with my first 12-18 months of struggle, hereâ€™s the truth:9 times out of 10, you donâ€™t have a knowledge problem.**You have a direction problem.**And for every conversation Iâ€™ve had with someone 2 steps ahead, Iâ€™ve taken 10 steps forward.But I mentioned before that these calls are limited to a first-come-first-serve basis.Also, this will be one of the last times you see this offer because the next time you might invest with me, it'll be a higher-priced coaching program similar to what I paid Dan Koe for.So, if you are on the fence about it, Iâ€™d ask that you give a good think â€“ but not for too long.This really is a great opportunity for the right person.

## FAQ

Iâ€™m a complete beginner, is this call going to be useful?

Absolutely. It wasnâ€™t long ago that I picked up my first copywriting book. In fact, as a complete beginner youâ€™ve probably got the most to gain from these calls because you can skip the 12 months of painful â€˜figuring it outâ€™ most of us do when we first discover you can make money online.

I canâ€™t decide what type of work I want to do, can you help?

Sure thing. Iâ€™ve got experience in sales pages, email marketing, ghostwriting, landing pages and more. Iâ€™ve released a product, community, coaching and consulting.  
Thereâ€™re a few things Iâ€™d recommend you donâ€™t do, and more importantly â€“ I can tell you which path would play to your strengths.

Will you help me afterwards?

Look, I canâ€™t stand people who promise to care about their audience and then go silent as soon as youâ€™ve paid. After our call youâ€™re gonna have steps to execute, and that means questions. My DMs will be open for you as youâ€™re making progress.

I want to pay for the call but Iâ€™m not sure I want to speak to you right away, can I do this?

Sure thing. I've limited my availability to ensure my diary doesn't fill up. But if you want to grab a slot and speak to me in the future instead, then crack on.

Iâ€™m still busy with my day job and I struggle for timings with these calls, can you accommodate?

No worries at all. One perk of not having much of a life and no boss to answer to is Iâ€™m pretty flexible. When you get your calendar invite, if the times donâ€™t work â€“ we can discuss whenâ€™s good for you.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about investing in a course, is this call a better shout?

It really depends on why youâ€™re looking to invest. If youâ€™ve got a lot of doubts about your direction then, from experience, chatting to people is always better than reading more information.  
Plus, Iâ€™ll point you toward some of the free resources Iâ€™ve used that have genuinely been 10x better than courses Iâ€™ve paid for.

What happens if I get to the end of the call and donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve got value?

Weâ€™ll have a pretty quick idea if the call isnâ€™t working and so we can decide that there and then.  
My priority is you winning so if my advice isnâ€™t making that happen for you, Iâ€™ll give your money back â€“ and point you to the right place.

How long is the call?

If we go even 30 seconds over 60 minutes, Iâ€™ll bill you twice.  
Just playing.  
Look. If I think we need longer to discuss stuff, weâ€™ll keep going. But generally, my clients are ecstatic after an hour.

Iâ€™m ready to go, how quickly can we speak?

Subject to my availability, but usually within the week. It depends on how many slots have been taken. So please do book in soon if you're keen for this.

_P.S. I really do mean it when I say that if you want to become a writer, this call could make all the difference. But I can't give it to everyone and thereâ€™re ~5,600 people being sent this link, so if youâ€™re keen, please donâ€™t hesitate._
