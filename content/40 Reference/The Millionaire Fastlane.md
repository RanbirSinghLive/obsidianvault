- the Fastlane is a state in which you no longer have to [[trade time for money]]
- the Slowlane is the typical get rich by 65, 401k mentality
	- the 'get rich slow' mentality is a losing game

### Mediocrity- The [[Slowlane]] Roadmap
- the thesis: sacrifice today for a better tomorrow
- characterisitics
	- debt is bad
	- time is abundant
	- education is important
	- money is scarce
	- a job is paramount
	- [[compound growth]] (interest) is key
	- give up on dreams

The slowlane equation is  wealth + job money + compound interest

### The [[Fastlane]] Roadmap
- signature characteristic of unlimited leverage
- characteristics:
	- debt is useful for growth
	- time > money
	- learning over formal education
	- money is abundant
	- business systems and investments are paramount

	- even the craziest dreams are worth pursuing

the fastlane equation

Wealth = net profit + asset value

asset value = net profit x industry multiplier

### Your Vehicle To Wealth
- to get on the fastlane you need to incorporate, so you can [[pay yourself first]]
- [[Success is not made up of a single choice but hundreds of them]].
- We have the choice of perception. It can lead us to act in certain ways. If we believe in ideas, we will act in accordance with them
- Related [[the last of the human freedoms]]
- To make better choices, change your perception
- Two [[mental models]] to use:
	- [[Worst Case Consequence Analysis]]:  "if i do this, what's the worst that could happen?"
	- [[Weighted Average Decision Matrix]]: assign weights to the various possible decisions and pick the best one

1. Need: there is a tangible need for this business
2. Entry: the barrier to entry is high
3. Control: play a game that you can control
4. Scale: can you freely scale up your business over time?
5. Time: your compensation is detached from your time
