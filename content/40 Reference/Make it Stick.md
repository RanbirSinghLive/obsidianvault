- Knowing *how to learn* is as important as learning itself but we aren't explicitly taught it
- This is similar to how we treat social skills
- Related [[Secret Semester]]
- [[Pluraiistic Ignorance]]: our intuition is heavily influenced by what our peers do. This results in collective ignorance
- good learning is not intuitive
- why the best practices are avoiding:
	- they require brain power (but less time commitment)
	- they make you come face-to-face with weaknesses
	- these methods don't require a lot of time, so it makes us think we're not working hard enough
- **The best learning tools:**
	- [[Retrieval Practice]]
	- [[Interleaving]]
	- [[Spaced Repetition]]
- These tools are best when used with these **two guiding principles**:
	- Principle-Based Learning
	- The [[Growth Mindset]] - believing we can learn new things through study and practise

### **The [[Illusion of Knowledge]]**
- Deluding yourself into thinking your smart after studying a little about a discipline
- **Don't mistake familiarity with mastery**

- Retrieval Practice - a form of self-testing
	- a good way to battle the illusion of knowledge
	- stops/slows the forgetting process
	- writes important things into long-term memory
- Retrieval Steps:
	- What's the main point of what I just read?
	- Write summary sheet without looking at source
	- Explain it to someone else
- Retrieval practice is done best in spaced intervals vs long stretches of studying

- Ebbinghaus [[Forgetting Curve]] - the rate of forgetting is extremely fast if no intervention taken
- [[Spaced Repetition]] is the best way to combat forgetting
- Tool: [[Anki]]
- How it works: be compelled to recall something **just before** you're about to forget it
- The forgetting curve flattens with each successful recall

- Blocked Practice - learning something once for 3 hours and never learning it again, then expecting to know it

- Interleaving - aka 'mixing it up'
	- Do different types of problems or review different subjects in an alternating manner
- [[Neuroplasticity]] - being able to learn new information on demand - the goal
	- Enabled by a growth mindset
	- Deterred by a fixed mindset
- Knowhow over knowledge - learning the principles behind what you're learning, and not just the facts
	- Asking the 'why' and 'how'

### **Other Effective Study Methods according to Make it Stick (in no particular order of importance)**

-   **Elaboration**
-   **Generation**
-   **Reflection**
-   **Calibration**
-   **Memory Techniques**
-   **Discerning whatâ€™s REALLY important**

### [[Elaboration]]
- Elaborating on something helps reveal hidden knowledge, allowing you to attain deeper understanding
- When you talk about what you've learned, your brain works to make connections and make sense

- If you can't explain things to a five-year-old, you don't really understand them

- Researchers have found that there's no limit to what you can retain if you associate new memories with older ones
