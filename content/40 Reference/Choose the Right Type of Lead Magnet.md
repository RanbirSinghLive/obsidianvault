But there are formats that perform better for simple topics and those that perform much better the more complex the topic gets.

For more simple topics, focus on the upper left-hand quadrant above. Those are high-converting lead magnets: templates, on-demand videos, live tutorials, and toolkits.

This type of lead magnet is both useful and simple to consume, leading to high conversion rates.

For more complex topics, check out the upper right-hand quadrant above. Consider consultations, online training, webinars, and useful worksheets.

While these are generally more difficult to consume, the lead quality of someone who gets through them will be astonishingly high.
