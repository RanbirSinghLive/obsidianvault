- [[human behaviour changes, not human nature]]
- [[humans reward talent & intelligence]]
- ideas are the strongest thing in history as they can be passed down and change future generations
	- the gun was originally an idea
- History is the best tool to understand the past and predict the problems of the future
- Knowledge of the past is incomplete. Historians always oversimplify
- [[History]] can't be a science - it falls more into art & philosophy
**- "Only a fool would try to compress 100 centuries into 100 pages of conclusions. We proceed."**
- History is a combination of past crimes *and* contributions
- The human story is collective learning over time
- The Three Worlds
- 1 - the external ('natural') world
- 2 - when humans attained consciousness
- 3 - the digital world
- how can we understand the news with knowing the throughline to history?
- history shows us the resilience of humans
- humans are each conscious with the universe isn't. This makes us nobler

Science
- [[geography]] relents to technology over time
	- this trend is projected to continue
- geography is the matrix of history. coaster dwellers become sea-farers
- neither our internal nor external factors can tell the whole story on their own
- some factors played an outsized role in our progress to today: genetics, culture, environment, and technology
- [[biology]] teaches us that [[life is competiton]]
- [[cooperation is competition]] - we cooperate within a group to compete with other groups
- biology also teaches us that life is selection
- Nature does not like equality. It likes difference so it can pick the strong and eliminate the weak
- [[Freedom and equality work as opposites]]
- The the below average desire equality. The above average desire freedom
- biology also teaches us that life is procreation
- every food technological advance is caught up to by an increase in mouths to feed
- [[Most of intelligence is the result of education, opportunity and experience]]
- The fertile inherit the earth
- The belief system with the highest birth rate will win in the end
- "All of the history of humankind is a short chapter in the history of biology. And all of biology is a short chapter in the history of the planet. And the planet is a short chapter in the history of the universe"
- [[Humans will only evolve past competition when we collectively face a greater foe]]
- Civilization develops regardless of race. In the end [[differences between people yield to the environment]]
- [[Delusion is a motivator]] - people like to think they are a little special which makes it a bit easier to push forward
**- "The imitative majority follows the innovative minority. History is largely the battle of a few minorities, the winner of which is then lauded as the victor by the majority"**
 - one person, in one lifetime, cannot learn enough to rethink and fully understand the entire society
- new ideas should be heard, tested and questioned
- Humans are what we have been throughout history. We change our behaviour but not our instincts
- Morals are a form of societal control
-   We can divide history into three stages: hunting, agriculture, and industry
- our greatest achievement is civilization
- to be a good civilization, it needs both order and personal freedom/creative liberty
	- these aims are at odds with each other so it is a balance
	- [[The Best Answers are Contradictory]]
- "It is very dangerous for an individual to think that — even with 30 or 40 years of studying — he can judge and overcome the collective wisdom of the human race. [[Old ideas are very powerful]]"
- Religion may have made civilization possible
- Related [[How Sikhism Shapes My Worldview]]
- The goal of religion is to overcome the impulses of our hunter-gatherer reptilian brain
- We overcome our animal instincts with social ones
- When all else fails, people will do what serves them best. They will try to ensure their survival
- Going against our self-preserving nature to sacrifice yourself for others fascinates us
- Religion got replaced by philosophy and then by science
- History's favoured religion, for argument's sake is [[duallsm]] - that there are two goods, a good one and evil one

- You should never trust an old man to be the judgment of youth because they would just cut off the bold things youth would do before they could do them
-   Idea: this boldness, in fact, is the only way that humankind advances. Most ideas we propose in our boldest moments are wrong. How could they not be? It’s not as if we are easily capable of thinking up something brilliant in our narrow window of time on earth. However, every now and then, the bold youth develops an idea that completely redefines the world and if we are to make progress, if we are to become better, we must be bold enough and delusional enough to believe that we can have those ideas.



**-   The men who can manage men, manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all**
-   Normally, men are judged by their ability to produce. Except in war, when they are ranked based on their ability to destroy
-   The concentration of wealth in a small portion of the population is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history. The most valuable talents and skills are confined to a few people, which means the most valuable wealth is confined to a few as well. This pattern shows up again and again
- Related [[Pareto Principle]]
-   Liberty is possible when security has been achieved, but until that point you are facing competition. It is only because of competition that we developed the ability to create liberty
-   The first condition of freedom is limitation. If freedom is absolute, then it dies in chaos. The prime task of government is to establish order
-   The [[Pax Romana]] was perhaps the greatest achievement in the history of governance.
-   If the majority of abilities are contained within a minority of men (that is, if a few people have more valuable skills than most others), then a minority rule is as inevitable as a disproportionate concentration of wealth.


-   The sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories. The sanity of the group lies in the [[continuity]] of its traditions. Break away from either too fast and chaos follows


-   The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character. The only real emancipation is individual. The only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints


-   The excessive increase of anything causes a reaction in the opposite direction

-   Idea: this is a disturbing thought, but once culture and shared thought evolved, we suddenly developed the capacity to perform large swathes of “natural selection” on those who disagree with us. Imagine a revolt within a country where one group commits genocide on another group. These mass killings are largely ideological. In a sense, we could say that these killings are a form of “survival of the fittest”, but in this case it is the ideas that the ruling group deems fit rather than physical fitness. Suddenly, ideology becomes a form of natural selection and because we are the ones with the ideas, we are now the force that selects them. If you take this line of thinking far enough, you get to some dangerous territory. Who decides which ideas are fit?
-   **You can’t fool all of the people all the time, but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country**
-   Democracy has done less harm and more good than any other form of government
-   [[The goal of democracy is not to make every man equal, but to make his access to opportunity more equal]] 


-   War is, paradoxically, the driver of much technological change and cultural change that leads to long periods of peace afterward
-   [[We can define progress as the increasing control of the environment by life]]
- If education is the measure of progress then we have progressed more than ever before. Education is the transmission of as much of human heritage and learning as we can fully achieve
- If progress is real, it is not because we are any richer or wiser than those of the past, but because we are born at a higher level and further up the pedestal of our heritage. We are born with the fruits of a larger portion of human heritage
-   **Do not feel depressed that life may only have meaning insofar as man puts into it. It is remarkable that we can put any meaning into life at all. The thing that is rare is the capability to even invent meaning for ourselves, for such a task appears impossible for all other animals.*


-   Do not be an optimist or a pessimist. Instead, be a realist. Accept that life is composed of difficulties and delights. The difficulties are a natural price of existence. The delights are goodies you don’t necessarily deserve


-   Human nature changes, but it changes at an incredibly slow, geological pace. We can say with reasonable certainty that human nature has been virtually unchanged in the last 2,000 years and quite possibly far longer than that. Human nature is strongly linked to biology. These are the intrinsic traits that we have and they change very slowly through evolution



-   “Consider [[education]] not as a painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as a transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage. As fully as possible to as many as possible for the embellishment of man’s understanding, control, and enjoyment of life. The heritage that we can now more fully transmit is richer than ever before. It is richer than that of Pericles, for it includes the Greek following that followed him. Richer than Leonardo’s for it includes him and the Italian renaissance. Richer than Voltaire for it embraces all the French enlightenment and its ecumenical dissemination.”


**- Revolutions are just surface level changes. Human nature remains the same. The people merely change with the revolution and fall back into the same underlying patterns**

-   When everybody owns everything, nobody takes care of anything

-   Most of the poor are victims of racial discrimination and environmental handicaps.

-   Persons under 30 should never trust the economic, political, and moral ideas of other persons under 30

- [[In old age, you understand how good it is that there should be radicals and how good it is that there should be conservatives. The radicals supply the gas and the conservatives apply the brakes. Both of those functions are indispensable. That tension is required for a functioning society]]
