Story Space, Story Time

Premise

     The story idea stated in a single sentence. Suggests
     the essence of the story.

Seven Key Structure Steps

     The seven key story structure steps are the major
     stages of the story’s development and of the dramatic
     code hidden under its surface. They are:

1. Weakness and need 2. Desire  
3. Opponent  
4. Plan

5. Battle  
6. Self-Revelation 7. New Equilibrium

     Create characters by drawing from the original idea
     and connecting and comparing them in a character web.
     Then, decide the function each is to perform in
     helping the hero develop.

Theme (Moral Argument)

     The author’s moral vision or how people should act in
     the world. Instead of making the characters a
     mouthpiece for a message, express the theme inherent
     in the story idea through story structure that
     surprises and moves the audience.

3

Setting (Story World)

     Create the world of the story as an outgrowth of the
     hero. It will help define the hero and show the
     audience a physical expression of his growth.

Symbol Web

     Symbols are packets of highly compressed meaning.
     Determine a web of symbols that highlight and
     communicate different aspects of the characters, the
     story world and the plot.

Plot

From characters, the right story form is discovered.
The plot grows from the unique characters. Use of 22-
step structure (the 7 steps plus 15 more) a plot is
designed in which all the events are connected under
the surface and build to a surprising but logically
necessary ending.

1.  Self-Revelation, Need, Desire
    
2.  Ghost & Story world
    
3.  Weakness & Need
    
4.  Inciting Event
    
5.  Desire
    
6.  Ally or Allies
    
7.  Opponent and/or Mystery
    
8.  Fake-ally Opponent
    
9.  First Revelation & Decision: Changed Desire
    
    & Motive
    

10.Plan

       11.Opponent’s Plan and Main Counterattack
       12.Drive
       13.Attack by Ally
       14.Apparent Defeat

        15.Second Revelation & Decision: Obsessive
          Drive, Changed Desire & !Motive

       16.Audience Revelation
       17.Third Revelation & Decision
       18.Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to Death
       19.Battle
       20.Self-Revelation
       21.Moral Decision
       22.New Equilibrium

4

Scene Sequence (Scene Weave)

     Before writing scenes, develop a list of every scene
     in the story with all the plotlines and themes woven
     into the tapestry. Place in a sequence.

Scene Construction & Dialogue

     Write the story, constructing each scene so that it
     furthers the development of the hero. Write dialogue
     that doesn’t just push the plot but has a symphonic
     quality to it, blending many “instruments” and levels
     at one time.

Premise

Premise

     Premise is your story stated in one line. It is the
     simplest combination of character and plot and
     typically consists of some event that starts the
     action, some sense of the main character, and some
     sense of the outcome of the story. What one chooses to
     write about is far more important than how to write
     it.

Examples.

The Godfather: The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather.

Casablanca: A tough American expatriate rediscovers an old flame only to give her up so that he can fight the Nazis.

Star Wars: When a princess falls into mortal danger, a young man uses his skills as a fighter to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire.

Create a story that may change your life by creating:

•

•

•

Wish list. Of everything you would like to see in
a story.

Premise List. Of everything you have ever thought
of.

          Core elements in both of the above
Look for possibilities.

6

     Where might the idea go? Explore your options.
     Brainstorm the many different paths the idea can take
     and then choose the best one.

     Ask “What if?” Let your mind go free. Don’t censor or
     judge.

Example.

Witness. A boy who witnesses a crime is a classic setup for a thriller. But what if you push the story much further to explore violence in America? What if you show two extremes of the use of force – violence and pacifism - by having the boy travel from the peaceful Amish world to the violent world of the city?

Identify Story Challenges and Problems

     Trick is to spot these at the premise line and not
     after the story has been written.

Example.

          Huckleberry Finn. How do you show the moral, or
          immoral, fabric of an entire nation in fictional
          terms?

Find The Designing Principle

     The seed of the story. An overall strategy for how you
     will tell your story. This overall strategy, stated in
     one line, is the designing principle of the story.
     This helps you extend the premise into deep structure.

     The designing principle is what organizes the story as
     a whole. It is the internal logic of the story, what
     makes the parts hang together organically so that the
     story becomes greater than the sum of its parts. It is
     what makes the story original.

     Premise is concrete and is what actually happens. The
     designing principle is abstract, the deeper process
     going on in the story.

7

     Designing Principle = Story Process + Original
     Execution

     Find the designing principle and stick to it. Be
     diligent in discovering this principle and never take
     your eye off of it during the long writing process.

Example. Tootsie.

               Premise. When an actor can’t get work, he
               disguises himself as a woman and gets a role
               in a TV series only to fall in love with one
               of the female members of the cast.

               Designing principle. Force a male chauvinist
               to live as a woman.

Moses (Book of Exodus)

               Premise. When an Egyptian prince discovers
               that he is a Hebrew, he leads his people out
               of slavery.

               Designing principle. A man who does not know
               who he is struggles to lead his people to
               freedom and receives the new moral laws that
               will define him and his people.

          Harry Potter Books

               Premise. A boy discovers he has magical
               powers and attends a school for magicians.

               Designing principle. A magician leans to be
               a man and a king by attending a boarding
               school for sorcerers over the course of
               seven school years.

Determine Your Best Character in the Idea

     Always tell a story about your best character. This
     doesn’t mean nicest. It means the most fascinating,
     challenging and complex, even if the character is not

8

     very likeable. This character should always be driving
     the action. Determined by asking:

• • • •

Get a Sense of the Central Conflict
     Ask who fights whom over what?

Basic Action/Single Cause-and-Effect Pathway

     Find the single cause-and-effect pathway by
     identifying a basic action that the hero takes in the
     story.

     The basic action should be one action best able to
     force the character to deal with his weaknesses and
     change.

Example.

          Premise. A man falls in love and fights his
          brother for control of a winery. (A split premise
          with two cause and effect trajectories)

          Premise. Through the love of a good woman, a man
          defeats his brother for control of a winery.
          (Much better because not a split premise).

Determine Hero’s Possible Character Change

     Character change is what the hero experiences by going
     through his struggle.

     W (weakness) x A (action) = C (changed person)

     Start with basic action and then go to the opposites
     of that action. This will let you know what your hero
     is at the beginning of the story (his weaknesses) and
     who he is at the end (how he has changed).

•

Who do I love?
Do I want to see him act?
Do I love the way he thinks?
Do I care about eh challenge he has to
overcome?

Write the premise line

9

• •

Examples.  
Star Wars.

          Premise. When a princess falls into mortal
          danger, a young man uses his skills as a
          fighter to save her and defeat the evil
          forces of a galactic empire.

          Weakness. Naïve, impetuous, paralyzed,
          unfocused. Lacking confidence.

          Action. Uses skills as a fighter.

          Changed Person. Self-esteem, a place among
          the chosen few, a fighter for good.

     The Godfather.

Moral Choice

Determine basic action of hero

Come up with the opposites of basic action
for both hero’s weakness and the hero’s
changed person.

Premise. The youngest son of a Mafia family
takes revenge on the men who shot his father
and becomes the new Godfather.

Weakness. Unconcerned, afraid, mainstream,
legitimate, separated from family.

Action. Takes revenge.

Changed Person. Tyrannical, absolute ruler
of family.

The central theme of a story is often crystallized by
a moral choice the hero must make, typically near the
end of the story. Theme is best expressed through the
structure of the story and the moral argument. The
author makes a case for how to live via actions of the

10

     character going after a goal. The most important step
     in this argument is the moral choice of the hero.

Don’t make the mistake of giving your hero a fake choice between a positive and a negative. To be a true choice, the hero must select between one of two positive outcomes and, on rare occasions, avoid one of two negative outcomes (Sophie’s Choice). Make the options as equal as possible with one only slightly better than the other. One example of choice between two positives is between love and honor. In Farewell to Arms the hero chooses love. In The Maltese Falcon (and most detective stories) the hero chooses honor.

Audience Appeal

Seven Steps

A story has a minimum of seven steps in its growth from
beginning to end. The seven steps are not arbitrarily
imposed from without, the way a mechanical story structure
such as three-act is. They exist in the story and are the
nucleus, the DNA, of the story because they are based on
human action. They are the steps that any human must work
through to solve a life problem.

1. Weakness & Need

     From the beginning of the story, the hero has one or
     more great weaknesses that are holding him back.
     Something missing within him that is profound and is
     ruining his life.

     The need is what the hero must fulfill within himself
     in order to have a better life. Usually involves
     overcoming his weakness and changing or growing in
     some way.

     The hero should not be aware of his need at the
     beginning of the story. The hero should become aware
     of need at the self-revelation near the end of the
     story.

     The hero should have a moral need as well as a
     psychological need. A character with a moral need is
     hurting others in some way at the beginning of the
     story.

Example.  
The Silence of the Lambs.

12

2. Desire

          Weaknesses. Clarice is inexperienced,
          suffering from haunting childhood memories
          and a woman in a man’s world.

          Need. To overcome the ghosts of her past and
          gain respect as a professional in a man’s
          world.

Problem – an aspect of weakness and need. All good
stories begin with a problem the hero find himself in.

Sunset Boulevard.

     Weakness. Joe Gillis has a fondness for
     money and the finer things of life. He is
     willing to sacrifice his artistic and moral
     integrity for his personal comfort.

     Problem. Joe is broke. A couple of guys from
     the finance company come to his apartment to
     repossess his car and he makes a run for it.

What the hero wants in the story, his particular goal.
A story doesn’t become interesting to the audience
until the desire comes into play.

One of the biggest mistakes is to confuse need and
desire.

     Need – overcoming an internal weakness. Lets the
     audience see how the hero must change to have a
     better life. Key to the story but remains hidden.

Desire. Gives the audience something to want along with the hero. Something they can all be moving towards at various twists and turns. On the surface and what the audience thinks the story is about.

Examples.  
Saving Private Ryan.

13

3. Opponent

Need. Hero John Miller must do his duty in
spite of his fear.

Desire. He wants to find Private Ryan and
bring him back alive.

     Must not be seen as evil but rather structurally and
     in terms of his function within the story. A true
     opponent not only wants to prevent the hero from
     reaching his goal but is also competing with the hero
     for the same goal.

     It is only through competing for the same goal that
     the hero and the opponent are forced to come into
     direct conflict again and again throughout the story.
     If they have two separate goals, each can get what he
     wants without competing in direct conflict and you
     have no story.

     The trick to finding an opponent who wants the same
     goal as the hero is to find the deepest level of
     conflict between them. What is the most important
     thing they are both fighting for?

     To find the right opponent, start with the hero’s
     specific goal. Whoever wants to keep him from getting
     it is the key opponent.

Examples.  
Star Wars.

               Luke’s opponent is Darth Vader and each is
               competing over who will control the
               universe.

4. Plan

     Action is not possible without some plan. The plan is
     the set of guidelines or strategies the hero will use
     to overcome the opponent and reach his goal. It is
     organically linked to desire and the opponent. The
     plan should always be specifically focused toward
     defeating the opponent and reaching the goal.

14

5. Battle

Example.  
The Godfather.

Michael’s first plan is to kill Sollozzo and
his protector, the police captain. His
second plan, near the end of the story, is
to kill the heads of the other families in a
single strike.

     Throughout the middle of the story, the hero and
     opponent engage in a punch-counterpunch confrontation
     as each tries to win the goal. The battle is the final
     conflict between hero and opponent and determines
     which of the two characters wins the goal.

6. Self-Revelation

     The battle causes the hero to have a major revelation
     about who he really is. This comes n two forms:

•

•

7. Equilibrium

Psychological revelation
Moral revelation

Everything returns to normal and all desire is gone.
The hero has moved to a higher or lower level as a
result of going through the crucible.

Character

Character Web

     The single biggest mistake writers make when creating
     characters is that they think of them all as separate
     individuals. The most important step in creating the
     hero, as well as all other characters, is to connect
     and compare them to the others. Consider them all as
     part of an interconnected web.

     The steps to creating character web:

•

•

•

•

Function

Connect and define characters in four major ways:
by story function, archetype, theme and
opposition.

Then, concentrate on the hero and build him step-
by-step to create a multilayered complex person

Create the opponent in detail (in many ways, the
key to defining your hero)

End by working through the character techniques
for building conflict over course of story

Every character must serve the purpose of the story
found in the story’s designing principle. Each
character has a specially designed role to help the
story fulfill that purpose

Hero (H)

     The most important character. Has the central
     problem and drives the story action in an attempt
     to solve the problem. The hero decides to go
     after a goal (desire) but possesses certain

16

     weaknesses and needs that hold him back from
     success.

     All other characters in a story represent an
     opposition, an alliance with hero, or some
     combination of the two. The twists and turns of
     the story are largely the product of the ebb and
     flow of opposition and friendship between various
     characters and the hero.

Opponent (O)

     The character who most wants to keep the hero
     from achieving his goal (desire). Not merely a
     block to the hero. Rather, someone who wants the
     same thing as the hero. Consider the deepest
     conflict the hero and opponent are fighting over.
     Hero and opponent is the single most important
     relationship in the story.

     There can be more than one opponent. However,
     there is only one main opponent.

Ally (A)

     The hero’s helper. Also serves as a sounding
     board allowing the audience to hear the values
     and feelings of the lead character. Usually, has
     the same goal as the hero. Occasionally, has a
     goal of his own.

Fake-Ally Opponent (FAO)

     Appears to be the hero’s friend but is actually
     an opponent. One of the main ways to add power to
     the opposition and twists to the plot.

     One of the most complex and fascinating
     characters in the story because torn by a
     dilemma. While pretending to be an ally of the
     hero, this character comes to feel like an ally.

Fake-Opponent Ally (FOA)

     Appears to be fighting the hero but is actually
     the hero’s friend. Not as common as the Fake-Ally

17

Archetype

     Opponent because not as useful to the writer.
     Cannot give the audience the conflict and
     surprises of an opponent.

Subplot Character (SC)

     The subplot is used to contrast how the hero and
     a second character deal with the same problem in
     slightly different ways. Through comparison, the
     subplot character highlights the traits and
     dilemmas of the main character.

     This character is usually not an ally. The ally
     helps the hero reach his goal. The subplot
     character tracks a line parallel to the hero with
     a different result.

Example.

The Silent of the Lambs

     Hero - Clarice
     Main Opponent – Buffalo Bill
     Second Opponent – The warden
     Fake-Ally Opponent - None
     Ally – Jack, Clarice’s boss at FBI
     Fake-Opponent Ally – Hannibal Lecter
     Subplot Character - None

Fundamental psychological patterns within a person, or
roles a person may play in society. Cross cultural
boundaries and have universal appeal. Each expresses a
fundamental pattern that the audience recognizes. But
be careful not to let an archetype become a
stereotype. Always make the archetype specific and
individual to your unique character.

For writers, the key concept of an archetype is the
notion of a shadow, or negative tendency of the
archetype, a psychological trap that a person can fall
into when playing his archetype role.

18

Therefore, each character possesses the strength of
the archetype meaning as well as the weakness of the
archetype’s shadow quality.

King or Father (KF)

     Strength – Leads family or people with wisdom,
     foresight and resolve so that they can succeed
     and grow. Defines what is right.

     Weakness – Can force wife, children or people to
     act according to a strict and oppressive set of
     rules and remove himself from the emotional realm
     of the family or kingdom or insist that others
     live solely for his pleasure and benefit.

Examples: Brando in The Godfather, Rick in Casablanca, Kane in Citizen Kane.

Queen or Mother (QM)

     Strength – Provides the care and protective shell
     within which the child or people can grow.

     Weakness – Can protective or controlling to the
     point of tyranny or use guilt or shame to hold
     children too close to guarantee her own comfort.

Examples: Wife in American Beauty, Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire.

Wise Old Man/Woman, Mentor, Teacher (WOM)

     Strength – Passes on knowledge and wisdom so that
     people can live better lives and society can
     improve.

     Weakness – Can force the students to think in a
     certain way or speak for the glory of himself
     rather than the glory of his ideas.

Examples: Yoda in Star Wars, Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Gandalf and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings.

19

Warrior (W)

     Strength – The practical enforcer of what is
     right.

     Weakness – Can live according to the harsh motto
     of “kill or be killed.” May believe that whatever
     is weak must be destroyed and so becomes the
     enforcer of what is wrong.

Examples: Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo in Star Wars, Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Sundance in Butch Cassidy.

Magician or Shaman (M)

     Strength – Can make visible the deeper reality
     behind the senses and can balance and control the
     larger or hidden forces of the natural world.

     Weakness – Can manipulate the deepest reality to
     enslave others and destroy the natural order.

Examples: Harry Potter in Harry Potter, Merlin, Phantom of the Opera.

Trickster (T)

     Strength – A lower form of the magician
     archeytpe. Uses confidence, trickery and a way
     with words to get what he wants.

     Weakness – May become a complete liar who looks
     out only for himself.

Examples: Beverly Hills Cop, Home Alone, Crocodile Dundee, Hanibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.

Artist or Clown (A)

     Strength – Defines excellence for a people
     (artist) or shows them what doesn’t work (clown).
     Shows them beauty and a vision of the future or
     what appears to be beautiful but is in fact ugly
     or foolish.

20

          Weakness – Can be the ultimate fascist insisting
          on perfection, may create a special world where
          all can be controlled or simply tears everything
          down so that nothing has value.

Examples: Stephen in Ulysses and Portrait of the Artist, Frankenstein, Holden Caufield in Catcher in the Rye.

Lover (L)

          Strength – Provides the care, understanding and
          sensuality that can make someone a complete and
          happy person.

          Weakness – Can lose himself in the other or force
          the other to stand in his shadow.

Examples: Etta in Butch Cassidy, Frankenstein, Kay in The Godfather, Rick and Ilsa in Casablanca.

Rebel (R)

          Strength – Has the courage to stand out from the
          crowd and act against a system that is enslaving
          people.

          Weakness – Often cannot or does not provide a
          better alternative, so ends up only destroying
          the system or the society.

Examples: Holden Caufield in Catcher in the Rye, Rick in Casablanca.

Examples.  
Star Wars.

                    Luke – Prince, warrior, magician.
                    Hans Solo – Rebel, warrior
                    Darth Vader – King, warrior, magician
                    Princess Leia - Princess

Individuate The Characters

21

You begin individuating characters by finding the
moral problem at the heart of the premise. You then
play out the various possibilities of the moral
problem in the body of your story.

Central Moral Problem
Compare Characters

     (Hero and opponent first and then all other
     opponents and then to allies and all other
     characters on the following parameters)

• •

• • • •

Variation on Moral Problem

     Make sure each character takes a different
     approach to the hero’s central moral problem

Focus on Hero

• •

• •

Determine Hero’s Character Change

• •

     Some types of character change more common than
     others:

Weaknesses
Needs

o Psychological

o Moral Desires

Values
Power, status and ability
How each faces the central moral problem

Make constantly fascinating
Audience identify with the character but not
too much
Audience empathize with hero but not sympathize
with him
Hero a moral as well as psychological need

Self-revelation (first)
Need

22

• • • • • •

Changed Beliefs

     The beliefs the hero challenges and changes over
     the course of the story.

Hero’s Desire (goal)
     Clarify the hero’s desire line.

•

•

Opponents

Child to adult
Adult to leader
Cynic to participant
Leader to tyrant
Leader to visionary
Metamorphosis

Single, specific goal extending throughout
the story?
When does audience know whether the hero
has accomplished the goal or not?

     Detail opponents. First describe how the main
     opponent and then each of the lesser opponents
     attack the great weakness of the hero in a
     different way.

Opponent’s Values
     List a few values for each opponent

•

• •

•

Minor Character Variation on the Hero’s Weakness and
Moral Problem

How is each opponent a kind of double for
the hero?
Give each one some level of power, status
and ability

Describe which similarities each shares with
the hero
State moral problem of each character and
how each character justifies the actions he
takes to reach his goal.

23

          In what ways are any of the minor characters
          variations on the hero’s unique weakness and
          moral problem?

     Four Corner Opposition
          Map the four-corner opposition for the story.

          Put hero and main opponent on the top line with
          at least two secondary opponents underneath.

          Label each character with his or her archetype,
          but only if appropriate. Many characters are not
          archetypes and don’t force it.

          Push the four major characters to the corners.
          Make sure each is as different from the other
          three as possible.

Theme

Theme

(Moral Argument)

Author’s view of how to act in the world. The moral
vision of the author.

Body metaphor of story:
     Characters – The heart and circulatory system
     Structure – The skeleton
     Theme – The brain

Dialogue is not a way to express the author’s moral
vision. This way, the morals often overwhelm the
story.

Good writers express their moral vision slowly and
subtly primarily through story structure and the way a
hero deals with a particular situation.

Moral vision is communicated by how the hero pursues
his goal while competing with one or more opponents
and by what the hero learns (or fails to learn) over
the course of his struggle.

The single biggest reason a story comes across as
preachy is because there is an imbalance between moral
argument and plot. Need to have enough plot to support
moral argument. Plot is an intricate choreography of
actions by the hero and opponents designed to surprise
the audience. It is this element of surprise, of
magic, that floats the moral sequence and gives it
punch.

The moral argument is most powerful when it is most
dramatic. That means, among other things, holding off

25

     the hero’s moral self-revelation and decision until as
     close to the end of the story as possible. Keep the
     question ‘Will the hero do the right thing, and will
     he do it in time?’ in the back of the audience’s mind
     for as much of the story as possible.

Create Theme Line
     Use Designing Principle to Create One Line Theme Line
     Theme Line Techniques:

          Traveling Metaphor – perfect foundation for a
          moral line because entire moral sequence can be
          embedded into the line.

Examples: Huck’s trip down the river; Marlow’s trip up the river; journey from Manhattan Island to Skull Island in King Kong

          Single Grand Symbol – Using a single symbol can
          also stand for the theme line.

Examples: The Scarlet Letter; For Whom the Bell Tolls

          Connecting Two Grand Symbols – Same benefit as
          the journey as the symbols represent two poles in
          a moral sequence. Usually signals a declining
          morality but can be rising.

     General Examples:

Ulysses

               Designing Principle: In a modern odyssey
               through the city over a single day, one man
               finds a father and another man finds a son

               Theme Line: The true hero is the man who
               endures the slings and arrows of everyday
               life and shows compassion to another person
               in need

          Harry Potter Books

26

               Designing Principle: A magician prince
               learns to be a man and a king by attending a
               boarding school for sorcerers over the
               course of seven school years

               Theme Line: When you are blessed with great
               talent and power, you must become a leader
               and sacrifice for the good of others

          A Christmas Carol

               Designing Principle: Trace the rebirth of a
               man forcing him to view his past, present
               and future over the course of Christmas Eve

               Theme Line: A person lives a much happier
               life when he gives to others

Citizen Kane

               Designing Principle: Use a number of
               storytellers to show that a man’s life can
               never be known

               Theme Line: A man who tries to force
               everyone to love him ends up alone

Oppositions: Express Theme Line Dramatically Through
Oppositions

     Split theme line into oppositions
     Attach these oppositions to Hero vs. Opponents

     Key Point: The moral argument will always be
     simplistic if a two-part opposition, like good versus
     evil, is used. Only a web of moral oppositions can
     give the audience a sense of the moral complexity of
     life.

     Three main techniques:
          Hero given moral decision

               Hero’s moral need at beginning
                    Some moral flaw at beginning and hero’s
                    desperation to beat the opponent which

27

          brings out the worst in him. He must
          get worse before better.

     Hero’s moral self-revelation
          Realizes problem comes down to a choice
          between two ways of acting

     Hero’s moral decision
          Usually comes just after the revelation

Each character made a variation on theme

     Determine central moral problem and decision
     the hero must deal with in the story

     Make sure each of the major characters deals
     with the same moral problem in a different
     way

     Start by comparing the hero and the main
     opponent. Then, the hero to the other
     opponents.

     Over the course of the story, each of the
     major characters should make a moral
     argument in dialogue, justifying what they
     do to reach the goal

Character’s values put into conflict

     Using character web, values of each major
     character put into conflict as they all
     compete for the same goal.

     Identify a set of values for hero and each
     of the other major characters

     Give a cluster of values to each character

     Make each as different from others as
     possible

     As hero and opponents fight over the goal,
     make sure their values come into direct
     conflict

28

Sequence & Story Structure: Moral Argument Sequence

     In a good story, the story structure converges near
     the end at the same time that the theme expands in the
     mind of the audience.

     Beginning. Hero and opponent in opposition but
     conflict is not intense and audience doesn’t know yet
     how values of each come into conflict. No sense of the
     story theme.

     Middle. Hero and opponent come into increasing
     competition and hence the converging structure.
     Through this conflict, a difference in values begins
     to emerge. So, theme starts to expand. Yet, in a good
     story, it’s still largely hidden but quietly growing
     in the minds of the audience.

     Battle is the convergent point and right after this
     the self-revelation and more decision. Theme expands
     at self-revelation and again at decision.

     The Sequence
          Hero’s Beliefs and Values

          Moral Weakness – Hurting others in some way. Not
          evil but acting from weakness or is unaware of
          the proper way to act towards others.

          Moral Need – Based on his moral weakness, hero
          must learn how to act properly towards others in
          order to grow and live a better life.

          First Immoral Action – Hero acts in some way that
          hurts others. Evidence to the audience of the
          hero’s basic moral flaw.

          Desire – Hero comes up with a goal toward which
          all else is sacrificed. Leads him into direct
          conflict with an opponent who has a differing set
          of values but the same goal

          Drive – Hero and the opponent take a series of
          actions to reach the goal

29

Immoral Actions – During the early and middle
parts of the story, the hero is usually losing to
the opponent. He becomes desperate and as a
result he starts taking immoral actions to win

     Criticism of Hero by other characters
     Justification of actions by Hero

Attack by Ally – The hero’s closest friend makes
a strong case that the hero’s methods are wrong

Obsessive Drive – Galvanized by new revelations
about how to win, the hero becomes obsesses with
reaching the goal and will do almost anything to
succeed

Immoral Actions – The hero’s immoral actions
intensify

     Criticism of Hero by characters grows
     Justification of actions by Hero grows

Battle – The final conflict that decides the
goal. Regardless of who wins, the audience learns
which values are superior.

Final Action Against Opponent – The hero may make
one last action (moral or immoral) against the
opponent just before or during battle.

Moral Self-Revelation – The battle produces a
self-revelation in the hero. Realizes he has been
wrong about himself and wrong towards others and
realizes how to at properly towards others.
Because audience identifies with this character,
theme driven home with great power.

Moral Decision – Hero chooses between two courses
of action thus proving his moral self-revelation

Thematic Revelation – In great storytelling, the
theme achieve its greatest audience impact at
this stage. This revelation is not limited to the
hero. Instead, it is an insight the audience has
about how people in general should act and live

30

          in the world. The insight breaks bounds the
          characters. Audience sees the total design of the
          story, the full ramifications of what it means on
          a much greater scale than just a few characters.

Genre Variants of Moral Argument (can be combined)

• • • • •

     When you let structure do the heavy lifting to make
     the moral case, you free up the dialogue to do what it
     does best, which is provide subtlety and emotional
     force.

     Most commonplace to use dialogue to express oral
     argument is when an ally criticizes the hero for
     taking immoral action while trying to win the goal.

     A second way moral argument comes out of dialogue is
     in the conflict between hero and opponent (most likely
     during a battle scene.)

     Third place to use moral dialogue is a scene in which
     the main opponent gives a moral justification for his
     actions, even though he is wrong. By giving the
     opponent a strong (though wrong) justification, the
     author avoids the simplistic good-hero-versus-evil-
     opponent pattern and gives depth to the opponent as
     well as the hero.

          Good versus Bad (lowest variation)
          Tragedy
          Pathos
          Satire and Irony

          Black Comedy
Moral argument in dialogue

31

Setting

                 (Story World)

Use designing principle to express setting
     The designing principle involves linear story movement

     The story world is everything surrounding the
     characters at once

     Take rough sequence found in story line and expand it
     three-dimensionally

Examples:

Ulysses

               Designing Principle: In a modern odyssey
               through the city over a single day, one man
               finds a father and another man finds a son

               Theme Line: The true hero is the man who
               endures the slings and arrows of everyday
               life and shows compassion to another person
               in need

               Story World: A city over the course of
               twenty-four hours with each of its parts
               being a modern version of a mythical object.

          Harry Potter Books

               Designing Principle: A magician prince
               learns to be a man and a king by attending a
               boarding school for sorcerers over the
               course of seven school years

               Theme Line: When you are blessed with great
               talent and power, you must become a leader
               and sacrifice for the good of others

               Story World: A school for wizards in a giant
               magical castle

32

Story Arena

A Christmas Carol

     Designing Principle: Trace the rebirth of a
     man forcing him to view his past, present
     and future over the course of Christmas Eve

     Theme Line: A person lives a much happier
     life when he gives to others

     Story World: A nineteenth century London
     countinghouse and three different homes –
     rich, middle class and poor in the past,
     present and future.

Citizen Kane

Designing Principle: Use a number of
storytellers to show that a man’s life can
never be known

Theme Line: A man who tries to force
everyone to love him ends up alone

Story World: The mansion and separate
“kingdom” of a titan of America

The basic space of the drama that marks the physical
boundaries of the world.

Having too many arenas results in a fragmented,
inorganic story.

Creating the arena:

•

•

Create a large umbrella and then crosscut
and condense. Describe the largest scope of
the story near the beginning and then focus
on the smaller worlds within it as the story
progresses

Send the hero on a journey through generally
the same area, but one that develops along a
single line

33

•

•

     Dramatize visual oppositions among characters.

     Return to the character web and tease out three or
     four central ones.

Detailing the story world

     Done by combining three major elements: natural
     settings, man-made settings and technology.

          Natural settings

               Ocean – Divides surface and below the
               surface. Surface is the ultimate two-
               dimensional landscape. Below surface is the
               ultimate three-dimensional landscape where
               all creatures are weightless. Oceans also
               divide civilizations and values.

               Outer space – The “ocean” of out there, an
               infinite nothingness that hides an unlimited
               diversity of other worlds

               Forest – A natural cathedral which
               symbolizes contemplation and wisdom.

               Jungle – The state of nature and primary
               effect on mind is state of suffocation.
               Gives audiences the strongest sense of power
               of nature over man.

               Desert or Ice – Place of dying and death at
               all times. When something comes out of these
               places it is because the strong-willed have
               gone there to be toughened and grow through
               isolation.

Island

Send the hero on a circular journey through
generally the same area. Like above but
here, hero returns home at the end.

               Make the hero a fish out of water

City

Biggest man-made microcosm is the city.
To codify the vast scope of the city,
storytellers shrink it down to a
smaller microcosm. One of the most
popular is the institution (often via a
large building with many levels and
rooms).

               Extensions of humans

               Fundamental ways characters connect to the
               world

               Any tool a character uses becomes part of
               his identity

Hero’s Change or World Change
     Consider the overall change in hero.
     Will the world change along with him or not?

Seasons
     Is one or more seasons important in the story?

     If so, try to come up with a unique way to connect the
     seasons to the dramatic line.

Holiday or Ritual

     If the philosophy of a holiday or a ritual is central
     to the story, decide in what way you agree or disagree
     with that philosophy. Then, connect the holiday or
     ritual at the appropriate story points.

Visual Seven Steps

     Detail the visual subworlds that you will attach to
     the main structure steps in your story. Look
     especially at these structure steps:

1. Weakness 2. Desire 3. Opponent 4. Apparent 5. Visit to 6. Battle

or need

defeat or temporary freedom
death

36

7. Freedom or slavery Focus on Three Major Subworlds

     Figure out how to connect the major natural settings
     and man-made spaces to the subworlds you use.
     Concentrate on the following three subworlds:

1.  Weakness subworld: If hero starts the story enslaved, explain how the initial subworld is an expression or accentuation of the hero’s great weakness.
    
2.  Opponent subworld: Describe how the opponent’s world expresses his power and ability to attack the hero’s great weakness.
    
3.  Battle subworld: Try to come up with a place of battle that is the most confined space of the entire story.
    

37

Story Symbol

Symbols

     Is there a single symbol that expresses the premise,
     key story twists, central theme, or overall structure
     of the story?

     Review premise, theme and one-line description of the
     story world.

Symbolic Characters

     Determine the symbols for your hero and other
     characters using the following steps:

     Review entire character web before creating a symbol
     for a single character

     Begin with the opposition between hero and main
     opponent

     Come up with a single aspect of the character or a
     single emotion you want the character to evoke in the
     audience

     Consider applying a symbol opposition within the
     character

     Repeat the symbol in association with the character
     many times over the course of the story

     Each time you repeat the symbol, vary the detail in
     some way

     Character Type

     Consider connecting one or more of your characters to
     a character type, especially to gods, animals or
     machines.

38

Symbolic Character Change of Hero

     Is there a symbol you can connect to the character
     change of the hero? If so, look at the scenes where
     you express the hero’s weakness and need at the
     beginning of the story and his self-revelation at the
     end.

Symbolic Theme

     Look for a symbol that can encapsulate the main theme
     of the story. For a symbol to express theme, it must
     stand for a series of actions and moral effects. A
     more advanced thematic symbol is one that stands for
     two series of moral actions that are in conflict.

Symbolic World

     Determine what symbols you wish to attach to the
     various elements of the story world, including the
     natural settings, man-made spaces, technology and
     time.

Symbolic Actions

     Are there one or more specific actions that merit
     symbolic treatment?

     Figure out a symbol you can attach to each such action
     to make it stand out.

Symbolic Objects

     Create a web of symbolic objects by first reviewing
     the designing principle of your story. Make sure that
     each symbolic object you create fits with this
     designing principle. Then choose the objects you want
     to give extra meaning.

39

Symbolic Development

     Chart how each symbol you use changes over the course
     of the story.

          Sets the frame of the story. Overall range of
          change of hero in story and gives the structural
          journey the hero will take. This establishes the
          endpoint of the plot first. Ask the following
          questions:

• • •

     2. Ghost & Story World

          Essential things that happened to hero before the
          story begins. Like backstory but not as broad.
          Two types.

1. Most common is an event from the past that still haunts the hero. Often the source of the hero’s psychological and moral weakness.

What will hero learn at end?
What does he know at the beginning?
What is he wrong about at the
beginning?

41

          Device to extend the hero’s organic
          development backward. The hero’s internal
          opponent. The fear that is holding him back
          from action.

2. Uncommon is where a ghost is not possible because hero lives in a paradise world where hero is free, but where an attack will soon change this.

     Story world, like the ghost, is present from the
     very beginning. It is where hero lives and is
     comprised of the arena, natural settings,
     weather, man-made spaces, technology, time. An
     expression of hero and shows his weaknesses,
     needs, desires and obstacles. If hero is
     enslaved, the story world should be enslaving.

3. Weakness & Need

     Hero has one or more character flaws so serious
     they are ruining his life. One is weakness. The
     other is need.

     Weakness comes in two forms.

1.  Psychological. All weaknesses are internal.
    
2.  Moral. Also this if it causes someone else to get hurt (has a direct negative effect on someone else).
    

     Need is what hero must fulfill in order to have a
     better life. Almost always requires he overcome
     his weakness by the end of the story.

     Problem is the trouble or crisis hero faces at
     the beginning of the story. Is aware of it but
     not aware how to solve it.

     Three types of story openings where ghost, story
     world, weakness, need and problem are
     established.

42

1.  Community start – Hero lives in a paradise world where everything in perfect harmony but soon to be disrupted.
    
2.  Running start – Hero has a strong ghost and lives in a world of slavery with a number of serious weaknesses, has both types of need, faces one or more problems. Most good stories start this way.
    
3.  Slow start – Involves a purposeless hero and hero’s self-revelation is to learn his purpose. Very few stories can overcome this huge structural flaw.
    

4. Inciting Event

     An event from outside that causes the hero to
     come up with a goal and take action. Small step
     but does connect need and desire. It jump starts
     hero out of his paralysis in the weakness and
     need stage and forces him to act.

The best inciting event is one that makes the hero think he has just overcome the crisis he has faced since the beginning of the story. But in fact, has simply gotten into worse trouble. “From the frying pan into the fire.” (Joe in Sunset Boulevard)

5. Desire

     Hero’s particular goal. Provides spine of the
     entire plot. Start the goal at a low level and
     increase importance of desire as story
     progresses. If started too high, then story can’t
     build and plot will feel flat and repetitious.
     But be sure you don’t create an entirely new
     desire. Rather the intensity and stakes of the
     original desire.

     Part of story success is based on levels of
     desire a hero has. A low desire throughout the

43

     story reduces hero and makes complexity of plot
     impossible.

     Levels of classic desire lines from lowest to
     highest:

• • • • • • • • • • •

6. Ally or Allies

     Once hero has a desire line, he will usually gain
     one or more allies to help him overcome the
     opponent and reach the goal. More than just a
     sounding board (though valuable). Really a key
     figure in the character web and one of main ways
     the hero is defined.

Consider giving the ally a desire of his own. (The scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz).

     But never make the ally more interesting than the
     hero. (The hero is always the most interesting
     character). If ally is more interesting, then
     redesign the story.

     Note: subplot character is usually not the ally
     because a separate function. The ally helps the
     hero. The subplot character compares his method
     of reaching goal against hero rather than helps
     hero reach his goal.

7. Opponent and/or Mystery

     Character who wants to prevent the hero from
     reaching his goal. The relationship between hero

Survive (escape)
Take revenge
Win the battle
Achieve something
Explore a world
Catch a criminal
Find the truth
Gain love

Bring justice and freedom
Save the republic
Save the world

44

and opponent is the most important relationship
in the story.

Best opponent is the necessary one: the character
best able to attack the great weakness of the
hero. Forces hero to overcome the weakness or be
destroyed.

A mysterious opponent is more difficult to defeat. In average stories, the hero’s only task is to defeat the opponent. In good stories, the hero has a two-part task: 1) to uncover the opponent and then 2) defeat him. Hero’s job is doubly difficult and success a far greater accomplishment.

In certain kids of stories like detective and
thriller, there must be a mystery to compensate
for a missing opponent. Detective stories
purposefully hide the opponent until the end. Yet
the audience needs something to replace the
ongoing conflict between hero and opponent. Here,
a mystery is introduced about same time as you
would introduce the main opponent.

Making opponent mysterious is extremely
important. Think of opponent as an iceberg. Some
of iceberg is visible above the water but most is
hidden below the surface and this is by far the
most dangerous part. There are four techniques to
make the opposition as dangerous as possible:

1.  Create a hierarchy of opponents with a number of alliances. All are related to one another and working together to defeat the hero. The main opponent sits at the top of the pyramid.
    
2.  Hide the hierarchy form the hero and the audience and hide each opponent’s true agenda (desire)
    
3.  Reveal all this information in pieces and at an increasing pace over course of story. More reveals near the end of
    

45

               the story. How information is revealed
               makes or breaks your plot.

4. Consider bringing hero up against an obvious opponent early in the story. As conflict intensifies, have the hero discover attacks from a stronger, hidden opposition or that part that has been hidden.

     Before introducing main opponent, ask these
     questions:

•

8. Fake-Ally Opponent

     The character who appears to be an ally of the
     hero but is actually revealed to be an opponent
     or working for the main opponent. Plot is driven
     by reveals which comes from the steps the hero
     takes to uncover the true power of the
     opposition. Every time a hero discovers something
     new about an opponent, a revelation occurs and
     the plot turns.

     Valuable also because inherently complex. By
     pretending to be an ally, the character starts to
     feel like an ally. Becomes torn by a dilemma:
     works for opponent but wants the hero to win.
     Usually introduced after the main opponent but
     not always if opponent has come up with a plan
     before the story begins.

9. First Revelation & Decision: Changed Desire &
Motive

Who wants to stop the hero from getting
what he wants?

What does the opponent want? (Should be
competing for the same goal as the
hero)

What are the opponent’s values and how
do they differ from the hero’s?

46

     Hero gets a surprising piece of information that
     forces him to make a decision and move in a new
     direction. Causes him to adjust his desire and
     motive also. (All four – revelation, decision,
     changed desire and motive – should occur at the
     same time).

     Reveal techniques to keep in mind:

•

•

•

     The more revelations you have, the richer and
     more complex the plot. But the revelation should
     be important enough to cause your hero to make a
     decision and change his course of action.

     Get away from the three-act structure that
     requires only two or three plot points or
     reveals. Average hit film has 7 – 10 reveals.

10. Plan

     Set of guidelines and strategies the hero will
     use to overcome his opponent and reach his goal.
     Be careful of having hero simply play out the
     plan. Creates a superficial and predictable hero.
     In good stories, the hero’s initial plan almost
     always fails. Opponent is too strong at this
     point in the story. Hero must dig deep and come
     up with a better strategy, one that takes into
     account the power and weapons at opponent’s
     disposal.

Best reveals are those where hero gets
information about an opponent

The changed desire must be a bend of
the original desire and not a break in
it. Like a river that changes course.
Adjust, intensify and build original
desire line.

Each revelation should be explosive and
progressively stronger than the one
that preceded it. Should build on the
one before it. This is what “plot
thickening” means.

47

     Training important in certain genres like sports,
     war and caper stories and when it is will come
     right after plan and before the main action in
     the story.

11. Opponent’s Plan and Main Counterattack

     Just as the hero has a plan and takes steps to
     win, so does the opponent. The opponent comes up
     with a strategy to get the goal and begins to
     execute a line of attack against the hero. This
     step’s importance cannot be emphasized enough.
     Each of these attacks is a reveal. The more
     intricate the opponents plan and the better you
     hide it, the better your plot will be.

12. Drive

     The drive is a series of actions the hero
     performs to defeat the opponent and win. Start
     with hero’s plan and continue to his apparent
     defeat.

     During the drive, opponent is usually too strong
     so the hero is losing. As a result, hero becomes
     desperate and often starts taking immoral steps
     to win.

     During the drive, plot development needed and not
     repetition. The hero’s actions need to change in
     a fundamental way rather than continue hitting
     the same plot beat.

13. Attack by Ally

     When hero is losing and starts taking immoral
     steps to succeed, the ally confronts the hero. At
     this moment, the ally becomes the conscience of
     the hero. Typically, the hero tries to defend his
     actions and does not accept the ally’s criticism.

     This attack by the ally provides the story with
     the second level of conflict after the first
     being the hero versus the opponent. The ally’s
     attack increases pressure on the hero and forces

48

     him to begin questioning his values and ways of
     acting.

14. Apparent Defeat

     About 2/3 or 3/4 way into story, the hero suffers
     an apparent defeat. Believes he has lost the goal
     and the opponent has won. The hero’s lowest
     point. Increases drama by forcing him to come
     back from defeat to win at the end. (As in
     sporting events when a team comes back, the story
     audience loves the same thing in a hero).

     Apparent defeat should not be small or temporary
     setback but rather an explosive, devastating
     moment for the hero. The audience must really
     feel the hero is finished.

     You want only one apparent defeat (although the
     hero can and should have many setbacks).
     Otherwise, the story will lack shape and dramatic
     power.

15. Second Revelation & Decision: Obsessive Drive,
Changed Desire & Motive

     After the apparent defeat, the hero almost always
     has another major revelation. If he doesn’t, the
     apparent defeat is real and the story is over.

     At this point, the hero gets another piece of
     information that shows him that victory is still
     possible. Now, he gets back into the game and
     resume his quest for the goal.

     This major revelation has a galvanizing effect on
     the hero. Before he simply wanted the goal
     (desire and drive) but now he is obsessed with
     it. Hero will virtually do anything to win. The
     hero becomes tyrannical in his quest to win.

     Makes hero change his desire and motive. The
     story turns in a new direction. Make sure all
     five elements – revelation, decision, obsessive
     drive, changed desire and motive – occur or this
     moment will deflate the plot.

49

16. Audience Revelation

     The moment when the audience (but not the hero)
     learns an important piece of new information.
     Often, they learn the true identity of the fake-
     ally opponent and the fact that the character
     they thought was the hero’s friend is really an
     enemy.

     This moment valuable for a number of reasons:

•

• •

     Marks a major shift in the relationship of her to
     audience. In most stories up to this time, the
     audience learns information at the same time as
     the hero. A one to one connection or identity is
     created between hero and audience.

     But with the audience revelation, the audience,
     for the first time, learns something before the
     hero. This creates distance and places audience
     in a superior position to the hero. Allows the
     audience to step back and see the hero’s overall
     process of change (culminating at the self-
     revelation).

17. Third Revelation & Decision

     Another step in the hero’s learning what he needs
     to know to beat the opponent. If a fake-ally
     opponent this is often the moment the hero
     discovers this character’s true identity, or what
     the audience learned in the audience revelation.

     As hero finds out more and more about true power
     of the opponent, one might think he would want to
     back out of the conflict. But on the contrary,

Provides an exciting pop in what is
often a slow section of the plot
Shows audience the true power of the
opposition

Allows audience to see certain hidden
plot elements played out dramatically
and visually.

50

     this information makes the hero feel stronger and
     stronger and more determined to win.

18. Gate, Gauntlet, Visit to Death

     Near the end of the story, the conflict
     intensifies to such a degree that the pressure on
     the hero becomes almost unbearable. Has fewer and
     fewer options. The space through which he passes
     often becomes narrower. Must pass through a a
     narrow gate or travel down a long gauntlet while
     being assaulted in every direction.

     This is the moment when the hero visits death.
     Myth stories, time when he goes to the underworld
     and foresees future in the land of the dead. In
     modern stories, the visit is psychological and
     hero has a sudden realization of his own
     morality. Spurs him to fight rather than retreat.

     Most moveable of the 22 steps and is often found
     in other parts of the plot.

19. Battle

     The final conflict. Determines who, if anyone,
     wins the goal. A big, violent conflict is the
     least interesting form of battle. Lots of
     fireworks but not much meaning. The battle should
     give the audience the clearest expression of what
     the two sides are fighting for. Emphasis not on
     which is the superior force but which ideas or
     values win out.

     The funnel point of the story. Everything
     converges here. Brings together all the
     characters and the various lines of action.
     Occurs in the smallest space possible which
     heightens the sense of conflict.

     Hero usually (but not always) fulfills his need
     and gains his desire. Also, where hero is most
     like his opponent.

     Battle is where the theme first explodes in the
     minds of the audience. In this battle, the

51

     audience sees clearly for the first time, which
     way of acting and living is best.

20. Self-Revelation

     After battle, hero for the first time learns who
     he is. Tears aside the façade he has lived behind
     and sees, in a shocking way, his true self.
     Facing truth about himself either destroys him or
     makes him stronger.

     If the self-revelation is moral as well as
     psychological, the hero learns the proper way to
     act towards others.

     Great self-revelation should be:

• • •

     Two pitfalls to making self-revelation work:

•

•

     Double reversal plot technique at this time is
     where a self-revelation is given to the opponent
     as well as to the hero. Each learns from the
     other and the audience sees two insights about
     how to live in the world. Ways to create this:

•

•

•

Sudden
Shattering
New

Make sure that what the hero learns
about himself is truly meaningful
rather than fine-sounding words.

Don’t have the hero state directly to
the audience what he has learned.

Give both hero and opponent a weakness
and a need

Make the opponent human, or capable of
learning and changing.

During or after the battle, give the
opponent as well as the hero a self-
revelation

52

•

•

     21. Moral Decision

          Once the hero learns the proper way to act in the
          self-revelation, he must make a decision. This is
          the moment when he chooses between two courses of
          action. Each of these ways stands for a set of
          values and way of living that affects others.
          This is the proof of what hero has learned in the
          self-revelation. Hero shows audience what he has
          become.

          Thematic revelation. An advanced technique. The
          audience sees how people in general should act
          and live in the world. This allows the story to
          go beyond the bounds of particular characters to
          affect the audience in their own lives. Done
          properly, can be stunning.

     22. New Equilibrium

          Once the desire and need have been fulfilled (or
          tragically left unfulfilled) everything goes back
          to normal. With one big change: the hero is
          either at a higher or lower level.

Revelation Sequence

     Revelations are key to plot. They should be separated
     from the rest of the plot and looked at as a unit.
     Tracking the revelations is one of the most valuable
     of all storytelling techniques. Needs to build
     properly.

•

•

Connect the two self-revelations. The
hero should learn something from the
opponent and the opponent should learn
something from the hero.

The author’s moral vision is the best
of what both characters learn.

Sequence must be logical. Occur in the order
the hero would most likely learn them.

Must build in intensity. Ideally, each one
should be stronger than the previous one.

53

•

     Most powerful of all reveals is the reversal. This is
     the reveal in which the audience’s understanding of
     everything in the story is turned on its head. They
     suddenly see every element of the plot in a new light.
     All reality changes in an instant. (Most common in
     detective stories and thrillers). Examples:

In The Sixth Sense, comes when audience discovers the Bruce Willis character has been dead for most of the movie.

In The Usual Suspects, when audience discovers that the meek Verbal has been making up the entire story and that he is the terrifying opponent Keyser Soze. Note, in both come at the end of the story that sends the audience home with a knockout punch.

The Storyteller (Narrator)

     Someone who recounts a character’s actions, either in
     the first person or the third person. Using a
     recognizable storyteller allows one greater complexity
     and subtlety. A storyteller lets you present the
     actions of the hero along with commentary on those
     actions.

     One of the most important decisions one makes in the
     writing process. Can radically change the way one
     sequences the plot. The vast majority of popular
     stories do not use a storyteller. They are linear and
     told by an omniscient storyteller.

     A number of techniques allow the author to take full
     advantage of the storyteller if used. The techniques
     right for the story should be used (not necessarily
     all of them).

•

Must come at an increasing pace. Audience
gets hit with the grater density of
surprise.

Realize the storyteller is probably the true
main character (hero)

•

Introduce the storyteller in a dramatic
situation

Find a good trigger to cause him to tell the
story

The storyteller should not be all-knowing at
the beginning

Try to find a unique structure for telling
the story instead of a simply chronology

The storyteller should try different
versions of how he tells the story as he
struggles to din and express the truth

Do not end the storytelling frame at the end
of the story but rather about three-quarters
of the way in

The act of telling the story should lead the
storyteller to a self-revelation

Consider having the storyteller explore how
the act of telling the story can be immoral
or destructive to himself or to others.

The act of telling the story should cause a
final dramatic event

Don’t promote the fallacy that a character’s
death allows the full and true story to be
told

The deeper theme should be concerned with
the truth and beauty of creativity, not
heroic action

Be wary of too many storytellers

55

“Plot depends on how the author withholds and reveals
information. Involves the ‘masterful management of suspense
and mystery, artfully leading the reader through an
elaborate ... space that is always full of signs to be read,
but always menaced with misreading until the very end.’”

Plots should be organic rather than a simple sequence of
events with no purpose and no designing principle. Organic
plot does a number of things: 1) shows actions that lead to
hero’s character change 2) each of events fully connected
3) each event is essential 4) each action is proportionate
in its length and pacing 5) plotting seems to come
naturally from the main character rather than being imposed
by the author on characters.

The history of plot evolves from an emphasis on taking
action to learning information, the two legs by which every
story moves.

56

              Scene Sequence

List All Scenes in Story (In one line)
Tag any Scene that Includes one of the 22 Steps
Ordering Scenes

     Make sure scene builds by structure not chronology

     See if scenes can be cut

     Opportunities to combine two scenes into one

     Add a scene whenever there are gaps in story
     development

CHAPTER NOTES

The average movie has 40 – 70 scenes while a novel has
twice this number.

If story has sub-plots or sections, label each scene with a
plotline and subsection number

Pay special attention to the juxtaposition of scenes. Focus
on the contrast of of content. Then, the contrast of pacing
and proportion. One of the best is the juxtaposition
between sight and sound. The cross-cut is one of the most
common juxtapositions where you jump back and forth between
two lines of action.

 Scene Construction & Symphonic Dialogue

Write Hero’s Character Change Before any Scene
Scene Construction

-   §  Where fits in hero’s development of character arc?
    
-   §  What problems must be solved?
    
-   §  What strategy used?
    
-   §  Whose desire drives scene? (Not necessarily the hero). What does this character want?
    
-   §  What is the endpoint of character’s goal (Desire) in scene? How does character’s desire resolve itself? (By knowing endpoint in advance, author can focus entire scene towards that point.)
    
-   §  Who opposes character’s goal (Desire)?
    
-   §  What plan will character use to accomplish his goal? (Character with desire comes up with the plan.)
    
-   §  Direct or indirect plan?
    
    •
    
    •
    

Direct Plan – Character states exactly what
he wants. Increases conflict and drives
characters apart.

Indirect Plan – Character pretends to want
one thing while actually wanting something
else. Decreases conflict initially and
brings characters together. But can cause
greater conflict later when the deception
becomes clear. (Other character will either

58

               recognize deception and play along or be
               fooled and give the other character what he
               wants.)

-   §  Will scene end in height of conflict or some solution?
    
-   §  Will there be a twist, surprise, reveal in scene?
    
-   §  Will one character end scene by commenting about
    
              who another character is deep down?
    
    Dialogue
    
         First write scenes without dialogue (Character’s
         actions tell the story)
    
         Writing dialogue (great dialogue) is like a symphony
         happening on three tracks at once):
    
              Story dialogue (Melody) – Story expressed through
              talk about what the characters are doing. Story
              dialogue is written the same way a scene is
              constructed.
    
                   Lead character states his desire
                   Character two speaks against this desire
    
                   Lead character responds with dialogue that
                   uses direct or indirect plan to get what he
                   wants
    
                   Conversation between the two becomes heated
                   as scene progresses, ending with some final
                   words or anger or resolution
    
              Moral dialogue (Harmony) – Talk about right and
              wrong action and about values or what makes a
              valuable life. Provides depth, texture and scope
              to the melody line. Not about story events but
              rather the character’s attitudes about these
              events. Characters express their values, their
              likes and dislikes. Two or more ways of life are
              compared.
    

59

               Lead character proposes or takes a course of
               action

               Character two opposes that action on grounds
               it is hurting someone

               Scene continues as each attacks and defends
               with each giving reasons to support his
               position

          Key words - (Repetition, Variation, Leitmotif)
               Taglines or single lines of dialogue

     Unique Voices
          Make sure each character speaks in a unique way

CHAPTER NOTES

“A scene is defined as one action in one time and place.”

“A scene is a ministory. A good scene has six of the seven
structure steps: the exception is self-revelation, which is
reserved for the hero near the end of the story. The self-
revelation step within a scene is usually replaced by some
twist, surprise, or reveal.”

Two objectives must be achieved in constructing any scene:
1) determine how it fits into and furthers the overall
development of the hero and 2) make it a good ministory.

The beginning of a scene should always frame what the whole
scene is about. The scene should then funnel down to a
single point, with the most important word or line of
dialogue stated last.

Many writers, in an attempt to be ‘realistic,’ start the
scene early and build slowly toward the main conflict. This
doesn’t make the scne realistic; it makes it dull. Rather,
start the scene as late as possible without losing any key
structure elements you need.

60

Once a scene has been constructed, use description and
dialogue to write it.

Dialogue is not real talk. It is highly selective language
that sounds like it could be real. Good dialogue is always
more intelligent, wittier, more metaphorical, and better
argued than in real life.

Dialogue is best understood as a form of music. Like music,
dialogue is communication with rhythm and tone. Also like
music, dialogue best when it blends a number of ‘tracks’ at
once. The problem most writers have with dialogue is that
they write their dialogue only on one track, the melody.
This is dialogue that explains what is happening in the
story. Great dialogue is not a melody but a symphony
happening on three major tracks at once.
