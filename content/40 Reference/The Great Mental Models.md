### Acquiring Wisdom
- a [[mental models]] are depictions of how things work
- They help our monkey brains simply the complex into computable chunks
- They are lenses to apply to problems
- for [[complex problems]], the more lenses (angles) we can view them through, the better
- We need to keep our understanding from mental models tied to realty, otherwise they lose their potential

### How We Fail At Problems
- not using other [[perspective]]s
- our [[ego]] gets in the way and we're afraid of being wrong
- if we are at a distance to the problem, we are shielded from the consequences of our actions and thus have a harder time solving the problem effectively
- all of these compound to create [[blind spots]]
- 'if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail'

### **Thinking Model #1: First Principles Thinking**
- a way to [[reverse-engineer]] complex problems
- In the [[Scientific Method]] knowledge is only good when it can stand up to scrutiny and attempts to falsify it
- First principles are things that are non-reducible
	- Think of a kid continually asking why until it can't be answered any further
- Methods:
	- [[**Socratic questioning]]:**
		- A line of questioning along the lines of:
		- _Why do I think this?, How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?, How can I back this up? What are the sources?, What might others think? How do I know I am correct?, What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?, Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?_
	- **The Five Whys:** 
		- This is the children asking 'why' phenomenon
		- If you hit a point where you respond 'it just is like that' you've found an assumption. This is not a first principle and can be identified as a problem

### **Thinking Model #2: Thought Experiment**
- using our imagination to create investigations on the nature of things that are impractical or impossible to recreate in real life
- The Steps:
	- asking a question
	- doing research
	- make a hypothesis
	- test the hypothesis with thought experiments
	- inspect outcomes and make conclusions
	- was hypothesis correct? ask follow-up questions
- This is helpful for impossible situations, alternate history and non-intuitive scenarios

### Thinking Model #3: [[Second-Order Thinking]]
- first order thinking - the immediate results of actions
- second order thinking - thinking of knock-on effects or thinking holistically
- not accounting for second order can lead to catastrophe
- easier to find examples of when second order was not considered than was
- aka The Law of Unintended Consequences
- i.e. paying for snake pelts in India meant farmers started breeding snakes

### Thinking Model #4: [[Probabilistic Thinking]]
- this is the process of estimating the likelihood of outcomes using math and logic
- helps focus on knowable probabilities in a complex set of constraints
- three aspects of probability to incorporate:
	- **Bayesian thinking**: we're allowed to exploit all prior info to make the call. This allows us to set a 'base rate' 
	- **Fat-tailed curves**: much less predicable than bell curves
	- **Asymmetries**: related to [[metaprobabilty]]: the probability that your probability estimates are any good
		- i.e. the lack of stock pickers to meet their probable targets and beat the market

### Thinking Model #5: Inversion
- this is when you approach a problem from the opposite end of the traditional starting point
- in other words, thinking backwards from the end state
- you can also flip between thinking forwards and backwards to add perspective
- two types:
	- start with assuming your hypothesis is true or false. then what else would have to be true?
	- to get to your goal, what will you have to avoid? what is left over?
- the steps:
	- state the problem
	- what is the objective?
	- what forces are supporting towards the objective?
	- what forces are deterring from the objective?
	- puzzle a solution. this will involved augmenting the supports and reducing the deterrents

### Thinking Model #6: [[Occam's Razor]]
- simpler explanations are more likely to be the answer than complicated ones
- avoid needless complexity
- simplicity also synergizes with efficiency. good in time or resource constrained environments
- i.e the face masks on the backs of villagers to deter Bengal attacks

### Thinking Model #7: [[Hanlon’s Razor]]
- don't attribute to malice that which can be attributed to stupidity
- this avoids conspiratorial thinking
- there's less true villains out there than we might have believed
