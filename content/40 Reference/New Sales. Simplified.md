- [[sales]] is a [[numbers game]]
- your job: connect with people to see if your solution meets their needs
- The process:
	- identify an industry
	- gather data
	- subscribe to relevant sales publications
	- attend trade shows
	- select 30 key prospects and work them
- most sales people have only worked in economic prosperity, so new [[business development]] is not in their wheelhouse

### **16 Reasons Salespeople Fail at New Business Development**

- hoping instead of acting

- not likable, low EQ, less adaptive
- can't conduct an effective sales call
	- you are there to find the paint point
	- sell, don't present
	- ask questions iso talking
- focused on babysitting existing accounts
- focused on volunteering/fundraisers
- don't own the sales process
- don't protect their calendar
- stopped learning
- not built for it

### **[[Framework]] for Developing New Business**

#### **The New Sales Driver Framework**
1.  Select targets.
2.  Create and deploy weapons.
3.  Plan and execute the attack.

**Select Targets**
1.  Where is business going to come from?
2.  Who should you be pursuing?

This is an opportunity to be strategic.

### **Things to Think About** 
1.  Who are your best customers?
2.  What are their common characteristics?
3.  What do their business look, smell and feel like?
4.  Where are they located?
5.  Size of markets.
6.  Where can you find potential customers with similar profiles?

### Target lists must be finite, focused, written, and workable.

**Finite list**: Work from a finite list when looking for new business. Zero in on a finite number of strategic targets. Work the list.

**Focused list**: Repeated calling on the same type of companies allows you to become an expert as you learn the language, nuances and business issues facing them routinely.

**Written list**: Write it down, make it happen.

**Workable list**: Create a list you can work effectively.

**Segment Account** 

1.  Largest in terms of dollars spent.
2.  Most growable. The best opportunity for incremental revenue.
3.  Most at risk. High probability of losing business.
4.  Others. Don't qualify for the above three categories.

### Questions to Help Identify Strategic Targets When Creating a List

1.  Who are our best customers (by industry, size, business model, location, etc.)?
2.  Why did they initially become customers?
3.  Why do they still buy from us?
4.  Who do we compete against in the marketplace?
5.  Why and when do they beat us? And why do prospects choose us over them?
6.  Who used to be our customers (said differently, who used to buy from us)?
7.  Why did we lose the business?
8.  Who almost became a customer but didn’t (deals where we came close but lost)?
9.    Who has referred business to us in the past?
10.   Who should be referring business to us?

### **Resources for Identifying Targets** 

-   Local Business Journal.
-   Hoover's
-   LinkedIn
-   Trade shows
-   Industry associations

Target contacts higher in the customer organization. [[It’s not harder to get to people at higher levels in an organization than it is to get to those at lower levels]]. People are interested in achieving goals.

### **Create and Deploy Weapons** 

Have the right sales tools to win at sales goals to acquire new business. Some tools include the following.

**Sales story**: This is foundational to everything you do in sales.

**Networking**: Building relationships is so important to success.

**Social media**: Provides an opportunity for you to research and connect with potential customers.

**Emails**: Primary way to reach prospects when making initial contact.

**Proactive phone calls**: Many fear making phone calls to prospects, preferring other ways to reach out.

**Voice mail**: This is the perfect way to  drop tidbits of the sales story.

**Traditional printed marketing materials**: Sell sheets, brochures, catalogs, and introductory letters to prospects sent via traditional mail. **I cannot remember the last time anyone has asked for these things.** They all want digital copies.

**Digital marketing tools**: Blogs, podcasts, online videos.

### The sales story is the most important tool in your toolkit. You need a compelling, differentiating, client-focused story for new business development sales success. The story is not about you. Prospective customers are not interested in what you do. They're interested in what you can do for them. That must be evident in the story.

Lead with issues, pains, problems, opportunities and results that are important to the prospect.

### **3 Critical Building Blocks for a Compelling Story**

**Client issues addressed** 

-   Customer pains we remove.
-   Client problems we solve. Opportunities we help customers to capture.
-   Results we achieve for clients.

**Offerings**

-   State what you do.
-   The services, solutions or products for which you bill customers

**Differentiators** 

Explain why you’re better and different from other alternatives.

The building blocks are necessary to craft a succinct, compelling, client-focused sales story. And the sequence is very important.

**Headline**: One to two sentence introduction. Helps to provide context and allows your audience to place you in category to better digest your story.

**Transitional Phrase**: Set stage to grab attention. An example,

 ### **_Senior marketing executives look to us or your company when they have X problem.  

### **Client Issues/Pains Removed/Problems Solved/Results Achieved**

**Example of Power Statements**

-   > Striving to achieve Result 1.
    
-   > Frustrated from dealing with Pain 2 and ready to take action.
    
-   > Under significant pressure to eliminate Problem 3.
    
-   > Committed to accomplishing Result 4.
    
-   > They’ve had it with Pain 5.
    
-   >  Facing threats (or regulatory pressure) from Issue 6.
    
-   > They are finally tired of living with Problem 7 and want help to tackle it.
    

**Offerings**: What you sell. Brief section of the power statement.

**Differentiators**: Strong list of reasons your company is the best choice to address a client's issue.

### **_(Your Company Name) continues to grow (or dominate our space) because we are very different from what you will find in the marketplace . . ._**

One thing I appreciated with New Sales, Simplified is that Mike Weinberg provides lots of examples so you understand what he’s talking about in the book.  When it comes to sales, your mindset matters. Erase all the scripts that don't serve you well.

Come from the position of wanting to help the prospect. Pay attention to your tone and approach. Don't use the “sales voice”. Use a casual and comfortable tone. You have to sound like a great conversationalist. Use call outlines and scripted talking points.

### **Three Magic Words** 

1.  **Visit**: Ask the prospect to visit with you because appointments sound clinical.
2.  **Fit**: Let's get together to see if we might be a fit.
3.  **Value**: We’ll review your current situation and see if we can bring some value to what you're doing.

Executing the Sales Process: You are responsible for executing a solid sales process. If you use PowerPoint:

1.  **Slide 1**: Title.
2.  **Slide 2**. Suggested agenda.
3.  **Slide 3**: Insert company name. Grab three to five relevant bullet points about the client issue from the Power Statement.
4.  **Slide 4**: Understanding of your solution. List several items from your discovery work up to that point.

### **Plan and Execute** 

Time blocking:

1.  Schedule time to prospect.
2.  Keep appointment with yourself
3.  Remain on task during the time allotted. This can be a challenge for some people.

### **List of Stages in the Sales Process** 

1.  Prospect targeted.
2.  Initial conversation.
3.  Meaningful dialogue/first meeting.
4.  Prospect’s need identified/fit established/mutual agreement to move forward.
5.  Second meeting/key data received.
6.  Presentation or proposal delivered.
7.  Deal closed and won.

### **Three Characteristics of a Healthy Pipeline** 

1.  It’s full.
2.  Shows movement.
3.  It’s balanced.
