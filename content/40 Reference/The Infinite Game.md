4.  [[existential flexibility]]
5.  courage to lead

**A Just Cause**
- a cause you are willing to bear risk for
- it cannot be attained, just gotten closer to
- it provides a sense of purpose
- there is no best in infinite games, as best is a permanent state
	- better is the way to go instead
	- better = [[continuous improvement]]
- growth is not a just cause, it is a result
- if growth is used as a cause, it results in an unhealthy culture

**Trusting Teams**
- allow info to flow freely
- mistakes can be highlighted
- help can be offered and received
- feeling of safety

**[[Worthy Rival]]**
- appreciate the strengths of your competition
- disruption is a constant, accept that and figure out how to respond

**[[Existential Flexibility]]**
- would you blow up your business model to advance your cause?

**Courage to Lead**
- "**Becoming a boss is easy. Leading a team is hard.**"
- the most senior person the org is to look beyond the org
- the CEO should be the CVO - [[Chief Vision Officer]]
- the CFO becomes the operator and the CEO the visionary

**Live a life of service.**
- "None of us wants our tombstones the last balance in our bank account. We want to be remembered for what we did for others. Devoted mother. Loving father. Loyal friend."
