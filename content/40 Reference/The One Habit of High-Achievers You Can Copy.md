- All the high-achievers practice [[gratitude]]
	- The Steps
		- Stop for a moment
		- Shift attention towards something or a social relation you have and value
		- This moves you into [[interoception]]
- This stimulates serotonin and oxytocin
- Serotonin release improves immunity, good for brain circuits and releases Dopamine
	- Dopamine then improves optimism 'sky is the limit' type thinking
- Oxytocin release triggers the 'love hormone'
- Gratitude triggers thinking that is conducive towards possibility
- "My insides are good. Time to focus on the outside"
