1/Attention is fleeting

(51:00)

Afghanistan was the largest evacuation operation in US history & is already largely forgotten in the news cycle.

Instead, we shifted our eyes towards Rock vs Smith or Depp vs Heard.

Meanwhile, the story continues on the ground.

2/Look upstream

(8:00)

Tim's company, Sheepdog Response, trains people in self-defence against active shooters in schools

Despite this, he's still keenly focused on looking further 'upstream' at the mental health crisis in young men doing these shootings

Get to the root cause

3/Look for the helpers

(43:00)

Tim quotes Mr. Rogers:

‚ÄúWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, "Look for the helpers.¬†**You will always find people who are helping**.‚Äù

This always helps me when I'm processing horrific news.

4/ The work continues after the news stops

(46:00)

Tim's NGO is still getting people out of Afghanistan, even now that the country is fully Taliban-controlled.

Since the fall, they've evacuated another 5,000 souls.¬†

Things still happen even if we're not hearing about them.

5/Our perceptions of people

(57:00)

On his evac flight out of Kabul, there was a medical emergency

When they called out for doctors, 17 people stood up, most of them Afghani

That's a far cry from the stereotypical representation of refugees

People are more than their label.

6/Radical centrism

(1:02:00)

Tim argues that most people agree on what issues we face: war, economy, poverty.

The wedges result from how we differ on treating these issues.

This is the point where ideals win over pragmatism.

Radical centrists try to fight against this.

7/Confirmation bias

(1:14:00)

Tim: If I think the number 17 is magical, I will see it everywhere I go.

When we're hard-set in our views, every observation we make will only serve to reinforce them.

We need to avoid becoming trapped in the echo chambers of social media.

8/Light after darkness

(1:53:00)

In a moment of darkness, Tim swam 2 miles into the ocean, unsure where he would end up.

He was saved when a woman reported his location to the coast guard.

Sitting in the warm rescue boat, he was grateful to have made it out alive.

9/The issue vs the individual

(2:29:00)

Often in politics, we focus on the issue vs the individual.

We focus more on Biden's age or mannerisms than what he stands for.

Look past the person to the idea they're presenting to improve your decision-making.
