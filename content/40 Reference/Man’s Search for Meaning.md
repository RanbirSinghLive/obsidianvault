- life is not a quest for pleasure, but instead a quest for meaning
- there are 3 sources for finding meaning:
	- Work - by doing something significant
	- Love - by caring for other people
	- Having Courage during turmoil
- **none of us can control what happens in our lives, but we have absolute control about how we feel about what happens and do about what happens**
- we all decide what happens to use mentally and spiritually. even in a concentration camp, we can maintain our dignity
- love is the ultimate goal
- salvation comes through and in love
- love permeates the physical and goes straight to the spiritual
- 'Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: [[the last of the human freedoms]]—to choose one’s **attitude** in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way'
- if your fate is to suffer in a concentration camp, your freedom lies in the way your bear that suffering
- we are primarily driven by the desire to find meaning in our lives and only we can provide our personal meaning
- there is no prescribed [[Meaning of Life]] but specific meanings at specific times in people's lives
	- this is discovered in the world rather than internally
	- happiness is not chased, it is created
- _“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!”_
- If there is a meaning of life, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering and death are inseparable from the life cycle
- if emotion causes your suffering, form a clear and precise picture of it and it ceases to be suffering
- _“[[He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how]].”_
- life entails taking responsibility to find the answers to your problems and fulfill the tasks to overcome them
- your suffering becomes a task to fulfil, and you decide how you fulfil it

### [[Logotherapy]] in a Nutshell
- Logotherapy is focused on the meaning of human life, and our search for that meaning
- Striving to find that meaning is the driving force in us
- this search can cause tension inside of us, but this tension is necessary for mental health
- this tension can be reframed as the gap between your current state and what you should become


The [[existential vacuum]] is:
- the erosion of some of our animal instincts, and simultaneously,
- the erosion of tradition

- this leads to the prospects of conformism or [[totalitarianism]]
- this vacuum manifests in a sense of boredom
- [[automation]] will leads to more leisure hours and we are not equipped to deal with that
- related [[failed predictions]]

- as we lose ourselves in serving/loving another, we become self-actualized
- we need to lose ourselves to enlighten outselves

- love is the only way to know someone truly
