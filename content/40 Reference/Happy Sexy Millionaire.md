Upward vs Downward Comparisons
- Upward comps i.e. to Kylie Jenner, always make you feel inferior and unfulfilled
- Downward comps, if done from a perspective of gratitude, are much better for you
- His theory: the [[COVID-19]] pandemic gave people perspective and resulted in more downward comps than usual
- This led people to trade in luxury goods or start making their own bread
**- Ranbir: This could be the answer to why[[ mental health]] stats aren't as bad as people feared they'd be as a result of the pandemic**

Living as a poor immigrant
- Steven never invited a friend over until he was 18 as he was embarrassed by his messy home
- at the end of the book he flips this and isn't ashamed anymore.

-  [[you are enough]] - this belief creates ambition to pursue goals for the sake of only fulfillment and enjoyment
- [[only compare you today vs you yesterday]]
- social media makes 'perfect' look normal so 'good' now looks abnormal
- happiness and fulfilment are infinite games
- Related [[finite vs infinite games]] 
- they are designed to play forever and you cannot win
- life is an infinite game that only ceases when you die
- you have to play it like there isn't a finish line
- [[the paradox of happiness]] - you cannot search for it to find it
- nothing in life has intrinsic value without context
	- i.e. old Nokia phones are garbage now
- we have evolved to make quick comparison-oriented decisions to ensure out safety from lions, but this doesn't help us in the modern age when we start assigned irrational values to things
- social media overwhelms our prehistoric brains by exploiting [[bias]], and limitations in the subconscious
- make your context smaller, healthier and realer
- our view of a complete life is skewed
- [[scarcity]] (not having all you want) makes the stuff you do have special
- there is a limit to the amount of balls you can juggle (science says 14) - a good metaphor for life
- choosing priorities makes them more valuable
- [[chaos is our order]] - reaching goals leaves us surprisingly empty. [[we thrive in the strive]] - hard work, failure, rejection etc.

- resist being put into binary boxes and write fresh rules instead
- don't want to change the world for it's own sake because that's bullshit and you just want the status associated with it
- it's ok to want less lofty sounding goals
- society simultaneously peddles you hustle culture and burnout narratives
- working hard matters - [[we thrive in the strive]]
- **the issues isn't hard work, it's what you work hard at the expense of**

**The Art of Quitting**
- use a quitting framework and have the courage to quit things when necessary
- the greatest force stopping all of us going in search of the right thing is usually the gravitational pull from the wrong thing. The last thing. The safe thing.

- the single force holding you back is the stories you believe about yourself
- validation is an inside job - only you can validate you
- it is the feeling that you arenâ€™t enough that will persuade you to spend your life chasing false external foals down dead ends
