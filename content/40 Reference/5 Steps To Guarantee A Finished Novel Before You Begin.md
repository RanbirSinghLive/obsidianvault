What if you could ensure a finished 1st draft before you start writing?

Setting the right mindset & systems will be the difference maker. The writing process should be fulfilling. But the benefits only compound once you have finished a product you're proud of.

Most novels start out with goal setting & a flurry of initial activity but then get abandoned. The messiah of habit forming, James Clear, explains it like this:

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” 

## People don't finish their novels because they lack systems.
- They don't start a daily writing habit
- They're uncomfortable writing bad
- They languish in the dark with no feedback

Here's a better way, step by step:

## 1. Set identity, not goals.

85% of New Year's resolutions fail.

Goals can only get you so far. To change behaviour, you need to change yourself. Instead of focusing on what you want, focus on who you want to become. Don't *want* to be a writer, *be a writer*. Once you set a new identity you'll want to live up to it, every day.

Identity is the best motivator.

## 2. Put your identity into practice.

Some aspiring writers like the *idea* of writing, but not the *work* of writing.

You don't need to start as a good writer. Writers, good or bad, are still writers. Don't get discouraged by the awful prose of your 1st draft.  Focus on your trajectory instead. Your latest results are always lagging indicators of your habits.

Once you set your identity, prove it to yourself with small wins.

## 3. Fight small battles for small wins.

You are what you do repeatedly.

Write, every single day. Small tweaks in routine will compound into amazing results over years. Becoming a 1% better writer each day will make you 37x better in a year's time.

Consistency will set you apart from 90% of the field alone.

## 4. Start caring about your environment.

How you write determines how well you write.

Some decisions to make:

- find the right time of day (set your sacred hour)
- keep a tidy, dedicated workspace for writing
- ease the friction to type words

I ease the friction by ignoring my phone when I wake up. I immediately log into Obsidian and start typing in an empty file. I don't allow myself to look at anything else until my mind is empty. I'll then cut & paste the valuable ideas into dedicated notes & work from there.

If you start your day doing the hard thing first, you'll be unstoppable from there.

## 5. Be accountable.

Writing a 100,000-word novel in your wooden cabin is pointless.

Let your work see the light as soon as possible. Find people to keep you accountable to writing. Find more people to give you feedback on your writing. Your writing will improve with each iteration of publishing & feedback.

Make this feedback loop run frequently.

That's what I'm going with this newsletter. 

My subscribers function as my accountability partners. They expect to see this come out every Tuesday. That serves as a forcing function for me to synthesize my latest thoughts.

It's also building my writing habit & drawing interest to my novel.

Setting the right systems in place will ensure that you finish the novel you owe the world. (Related: [[It’s Time To Write the Novel You Owe the World. Start Here.]])

# Spokes:
## Pre-CTA:
You can assure a finished novel before you begin

The key is mindset & systems

1. Identity
2. Small wins
3. Writing environment
4. Accountability

Tomorrow I'll show my subscribers how

Get your systems perfect & the novel will write itself

## Post-CTA:
I know my novel will be finished before I've even begun writing.

I believe in my systems.

I will continue optimizing them to reach the goal.

On Tuesday, my subscribers learned to do it themselves.

## Tweet:

- [x] Can I add new context?

There are 1,325 excuses to not write online today.

You need a forcing function to push through:

1. Start a newsletter
2. Join a cohort course
3. Set a Tweet schedule

End choice & great returns will follow.

It took J.R.R. Tolkien 7 years to write the Hobbit, his 1st commercial success.

What if he'd stopped in year 6?

Success in some ventures is all or nothing. So what can we do about that?

1. Hedge your big project with small side bets
2. Iterate off feedback - early & often
3. Join a community with the same mission
4. Find benefit in the process vs the end result

Set up the right systems & leverage consistency over intensity.
