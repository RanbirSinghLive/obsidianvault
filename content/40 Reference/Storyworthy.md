- ##### [[Stories must reflect change over time]]
- Stories cannot just be a series of interesting events
- You must start as one version of yourself and end as a slightly different version
- Anecdote - a story with no change over time
- Stories are all around us if we stop and try to pay attention to them
- Improved storytelling runs parallels with trying to improve at social roles in your life (eg husband, friend, son)
- No one wants to hear your vacation stories
- "If you have commitment and faith, you will find stories. So many stories."
- Tell me the facts and I’ll learn. Tell me the truth and I’ll believe. But tell me a story and it will live in my heart forever. — Ancient proverb
- All stories, regardless of length come down to a 5 second moment
- This moment is the end of your story. Find the opposite of that moment in the past for the protagonist. That is the beginning of the story
- Do not make commentary on the impact of you're story i.e. "this is hilarious"
- Stories are boring when they lack the meaningful stakes
- Attach every moment in your story to a physical location
- Instead of using 'and' as a connective tissue, use 'but' and 'therefore'
- "The goal of storytelling is to connect with your audience. It's not about a rollercoaster ride of excitement. It's about bridging the gap between you and another person by creating a space of authenticity, vulnerability and universal truth."
- End on an emotional moment, not a funny moment
- [[Failure is more compelling than success]]
- If telling a success story, self-deprecate and minimize your accomplishment
	- make it about a small step instead of a large leap
- Only memorize the beginning, end and the scenes in general time
