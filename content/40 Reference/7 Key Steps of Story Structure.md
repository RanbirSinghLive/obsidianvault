[[John Truby]][[Anatomy of a Story]] #craft


**Weakness**: Something is missing from hero. It is so profound that it is ruining his life.

**Psychological Need**: What the hero must fulfill within himself in order to have a better life. Usually involves overcoming the weakness or growing in some way. The hero should be blind to his need until near the end. Psych need only effects the hero.

**Moral Need**: What the hero must fulfill to act properly towards other people.

**Problem**: An outside manifestation of the hero's weakness. Highlights weakness for audience & propels the story forward

**Tips**:
- Connect moral & psych needs
- Turn a strength into a weakness
- Moral need usually comes out of a psychological one
- Hero has a psych weakness that leads him to take it out on others

1. Start with the psychological weakness
2. Figure out what kind of immoral action might naturally come out of that
3. Identify the deep-seated moral weakness and need that are the source of this action

A second technique for creating a good moral need is to push a strength so far that it becomes a weakness:

1. Identify a virtue in your character
2. Make him so passionate about it that it becomes oppressive.  
3. Come up with a value the character believes in
4. Then find the negative version of that value.

**Desire**: The hero's goal. What he wants. 
- Desire puts the story on rails. It is the driving force in the story that everything else hangs off
- Desire & need are connected. When the goal is accomplished, the need is fulfilled.
- Need is internal weakness, partially paralyzing the character.
- Desire is external goal that requires action
- Audience:
	- Need tells audience how the hero must change to have a better life.
	- It remains hidden under the surface
	- Desire gives audience something to want alongside the hero. They call all be on the rail line together.
	- It is on the surface & is what the audience *thinks* the story is about

**Tips**:
- Your hero's true desire is what he wants in the story, not in life

**Opponent**:
- Antagonist - not necessarily evil
- Only an opponent structurally in terms of the story
- **A true opponent wants to prevent the hero's desire, but is also competing for that same desire**
- This links the hero & opponent organically
- If they have 2 separate goals, they can each get what they want without coming into direct conflict. Then there's no story.
- Not always obvious:
	- Detective wants to catch Killer
	- Killer wants to escape
	- **They are fighting each other for which version of reality everyone will believe**

**Tips**:
- Find the deepest level of conflict between them
- What is the most important thing they are fighting about?
- That must be the focus of the story
- To find the right opponent, start with the hero's specific goal; whoever wants to keep him from it is the opponent
- Opponent can't be himself - that is a weakness

**Plan**:
- guidelines or strategies hero will use to overcome the opponent and attain the goal
- organically linked to desire & opponent
- the plan may be vague
- in heist movies the plan is written down so the audience can follow along

**Battle**:
- through the story middle, the hero & opponent engage in a tit-for-tat confrontation as each tries to get to the same goal
- The Battle is the final confrontation and determines who wins the goal
- could be violent or with words

**Self-Revelation**:
- the intensity & pain of the battle causes the hero to have a major revelation about who he really is
- this needs to be done in a quality manner
- like need, there is a psych & a moral self-revelation
- psych revs - hero strips away the facade he has lived behind  & sees himself
- the facade stripping is an active act & most courageous one hero will perform
- Don't be blatant via dialogue
- suggestion the self-rev by actions he has done leading up to it
- self-rev is most closely connected to need
- the 2 steps communicate the character change of the hero (beginning & end)
- self-rev is what allows him to live a better life

**New Equilibrium**:
- Point where we return to normal & all desire is gone
- Except 1 major difference:
	- The hero has moved to a higher or lower level as a result of journey
- fundamental & permanent change in hero
	- if positive - realize true self & live properly in the world
	- if negative - realizes his crime & corrupt personal flaw

# Writing Exercise:
- Story Events
	- Write down some story events, each in 1 sentence
	- list events first, don't follow the structure
	- events are usually actions taken by hero or opponent
	- min of 5 but 10-15 is goal
- Order of Events
	- Put events in rough order
- Seven Steps
	- Study the events & identify the 7 steps
	- Start by identifying self-revelation, & then need & desire
	- Psych & Moral Self-Rev
		- be specific about what the hero learns
		- be flexible & ready to change as you write the novel
	- Psych & Moral Weakness & Need
		- come up with multiple of each
	- Problem
	- Desire
	- Opponent
	- Plan
	- Battle
	- New Equilibrium
