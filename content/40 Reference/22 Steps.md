## Char Exercise:
- Character Web by Story Function and Archetype
	- Create your character web
	- Start by listing all of your characters, and describe what function they play in the story (for example, hero, main opponent, ally, fake-ally opponent, subplot character)
	- Write down next to each character the archetype, if any, that applies
- Central Moral Problem
	- List the central moral problem of the story
- Comparing the Characters:
	- List and compare the following structure elements for all your characters
		1. Weaknesses  
		2. Need, both psychological and moral 
		3. Desire
		4. Values  
		5. Power, status, and ability  
		6. How each faces the central moral problem  
		- Begin the comparison between your hero and main opponent.  
- Variation on the Moral Problem 
	- Make sure each character takes a different approach to the hero's central moral problem
- Requirements of a Hero 
	- Now concentrate on fleshing out your hero
	- Begin by making sure you have incorporated the four requirements of any great hero:
		1. Make your lead character constantly fascinating.
		2. Make the audience identify with the character, but not too much.
		3. Make the audience empathize with your hero, not sympathize.
		4. Give your hero a moral as well as a psychological need.
- Hero's Character Change 
	- Determine your hero's character change
	- Write down the self-revelation first, and then go back to the need
	- Make sure the self-revelation actually solves the need
	- In other words, whatever lies or crutches the hero is living within the beginning must be faced at the self-revelation and overcome
- Changed Beliefs 
	- Write down the beliefs your hero challenges and changes over the course of your story
- Hero's Desire 
	- Clarify your hero's desire line
	- Is it a single, specific goal that extends throughout the story? 
	- When does the audience know whether the hero has accomplished the goal or not?
	- Opponents 
		- Detail your opponents
		- First describe how your main opponent and each of your lesser opponents attack the great weakness of your hero in a different way.
	- Opponents' Values 
		- List a few values for each opponent.
		- How is each opponent a kind of double for the hero?
		- Give each some level of power, status, and ability, and describe what similarities each shares with the hero.
	- State in one line the moral problem of each character and how each character justifies the actions he takes to reach his goal.
- Minor Character Variation on the Hero's Weakness and Moral Problem 
	- In what ways are any of the minor characters variations on the hero's unique weakness and moral problem?
- Four-Corner Opposition 
	- Map out the four-corner opposition for your story
	- Put your hero and main opponent on the top line with at least two secondary opponents underneath
	- Label each character with his or her archetype, but only if it is appropriate.
	- Many characters are not archetypes. Don't force it.
- Push the four major characters to the corners
	- That is, make sure each is as different from the other three as possible
	- The best way to ensure that is to focus on how the values of each differ.

## Moral Argument
- ## Designing Principle 
	- Start by turning the designing principle of your story into a theme line. The theme line is your view about right and wrong action, in this story, stated in one sentence. As you look again at the designing principle, focus on its key actions and their moral effects.
- ## Theme Line Techniques 
	- Look for any techniques, like symbols, that can condense your moral statement to one line or can encapsulate the unique structure you will give to your story.
- ## Moral Choice 
	- Write down the key choice the hero must make near the end of the story.
- ## Moral Problem 
	- After reviewing your work on premise, state in one line the central moral problem your hero will confront throughout the story.
- ## Characters as Variations on a Theme
	- Starting with the hero and the main opponent, describe how each major character approaches the central moral problem of the story in a different way.
- ## Values in Conflict
	- List the key values of each of the major characters, and explain how those values will come into conflict as each character tries to reach the goal.
- ## Moral argument
	- Detail the moral argument you will make through the structure of the story, using the following sequence:
		- ### Hero's Beliefs and Values 
			- Restate your hero's essential beliefs and values.
		- Moral Weakness 
			- What is your hero's main weakness when it comes to acting toward others?
		- Moral Need 
			- What must your hero learn by the end of the story about the right way to act and live in the world?
		- First Immoral Action 
			- Describe the first action your hero takes that hurts someone else in the story. Make sure it is an outgrowth of your hero's great moral weakness.
		- Desire
			- Restate your hero's specific goal.
		-  Drive 
			- List the actions your hero will take to win that goal.
		- Immoral Actions 
			- In what way, if any, are these actions immoral? Criticism: For any immoral action, describe the criticism, if any, that

the hero receives.Justification: How does the hero justify each immoral action?

■ Attack by Ally Explain in detail the main moral attack that the ally makes against the hero. Again, write down how the hero justifies himself.

■ Obsessive Drive Describe when and how your hero becomes obsessed with winning. Put another way, is there a moment when your hero decides to do almost anything to win?

■ Immoral Actions While obsessed with winning, what immoral steps does your hero take?

Criticism: Describe the criticism, if any, that the hero faces for these actions.

Justification: Explain how the hero justifies his methods. ■ Battle During the final battle, how do you express which values, the hero's or the opponent's, are superior in

this fight?  
■ Final Action Against Opponent Does your hero

take a final action against the opponent, whether moral or immoral, before or during the battle?

■ Moral Self-Revelation What, if anything, does your hero learn morally at the end of the story? Be sure that this insight is about how to act properly toward others. ■ Moral Decision Does the hero make a decision between two

courses of action near the end of the story? ■ Thematic Revelation Can you think of a story event in which you express your vision of how human beings should act in some other way than through the self-revelation of your hero?
