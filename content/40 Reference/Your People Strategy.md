You cannot *make* anyone do anything. You need to make them *want* to do the thing.

Create a game the people in your organization want to play.

**The Game**: 'The clearly defined structure you give them for acting in the world'

This concept is almost like the Wizard behind the OZ I've been seeing through my META motif

People's propensity to 'do what you want' is linear with their desire to play your game.

Their desire depends on how well you communicate the game to them at the outset of your relationship.

What Constitutes the Game:
- Org Chart
- [[SOPs]]
- Your (the owner's) worlds and actions

Characteristics of the 'People Game':
- The rules are predetermined
- You would play it yourself
- It can be won but not ended
- Change the tactics from time to time
- Make reminders
- It has to make sense
- Fun, sometimes
- Steal a good game if needed

Create a game that has logic. The other games people play are sometimes illogical (relationships, family, status). Make this game make sense, and make the reward for winning come true. 

**If people can't hope to win other games, make them believe they can win your game**

Make a Game Worth Playing

**Me:**
I liked [[Network Planning]] because I bought into the rules and I 'knew' what we were optimizing for. The times I was the most frustrated were when decisions we made that didn't make sense in the way the rules of the game were laid out to me. I.E. [[routes]] launched without good evaluations
