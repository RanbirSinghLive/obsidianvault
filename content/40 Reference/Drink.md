- When we're [[drinking]] we're actually ingesting a cocktail of psychoactive substances that change our brain. The primary drug is ethanol
- All alcohol is actually a mix of multiple types of alcohol

- **Stages of drunkenness:**

Blood alcohol content:
- 20mg% – relaxed, slightly altered mood
- 50mg% – less inhibition, louder speech, more gesturing
- 80mg% – drink-driving limit, loss of coordination, balance, speech, hearing and reaction times
- 100mg% – slurred speech, reduced reaction times and physical control
- 150mg% – euphoria, coordination reduced so much that you may fall over
- 250mg% – confusion, stupor, disorientation, loss of pain response, hard to stand
- 300-400mg% – possibility of falling unconscious
- 400mg% – stupor
- 500mg% – coma
- 600mg% – breathing stops and death

**The hidden dangers of [[tolerance]]**
- toxicity of booze varies on [[genetics]] and past drinking experience
- High tolerance can lead to overdosing
- men get drunk slower as they have a lower body fat content
- eating increases tolerance

**How to prevent a hangover**
1.  Drink less. 
2.  Pace yourself – drink slowly and let your body process the alcochol
3.  Drink water with your alcoholic drinks – dilute alcohol with ice, soda, lemonade or mixers
4.  Drink smaller measures – shrinking your glass means less booze over the course of the evening
5.  **Drink clear spirits** – they contain fewer congeners which are thought to make hangovers worse

**Less is always safer**
No amount of alcohol is safe and carries any health benefits. 
The upside is all social, which does have an intangible benefit for some

**Stop drinking immediately when…** you start to get drunk on small amounts of alcohol. If it becomes clear this is happening to you, you must stop drinking immediately. You’re facing terminal liver failure. 

**What [[alcohol]] does to your [[mental health]]**
- this is a [[chicken and egg]] problem.
- Are patients using alcohol as a form of self-medication? Or has alcohol changed their brains and deteroried their mental health? There’s another conundrum: as a doctor, which one should you treat first?

**What if there’s an alcohol that’s not toxic?**
Over the past 15 years, David has been working on this with a small team. He refers to this concept as Alcarelle, which involves developing compounds that are more selective than alcohol. The goal is to replicate the social and relaxation effects of alcohol without its unwanted effects. [[Alcarelle]] will focus on the science and the drinks companies will be able to license the technology, formulate their own flavoring, branding and market their own range of new-generation beverages.
