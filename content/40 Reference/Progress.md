-   why prosperity is the cornerstone of environmentalism;
-   why wars are much less lethal than they used to be; and
-   why literacy is so important to tackling poverty.

### [[Hunger is slowly becoming a thing of the past thanks to improved food production]].
- in the 17th century, [[famine]] was common in Europe, costing millions of lives in the century
- In Finland, a third of the population died as a result of famine between 1695 and 1697
- Average calorie consumption in France and England in the eighteenth century was lower than it currently is in sub-Saharan Africa
- farmers were granted _property rights_ in the nineteenth century, they were given an [[incentive]] to produce more food, as they could sell surplus crops for profit
- Meanwhile, opening up borders to _global trade_ provided different regions with an opportunity to specialize in particular areas. That made food production much more efficient
- Scientists and entrepreneurs developed innovations like artificial fertilizer, modern milking machines and combine harvesters
- the combine harvester can now do as much work in just six minutes as 25 men once did in a day. 2500x increase in productivity
- In 1961, there were 51 countries in which the average person consumed less than 2,000 calories a day. By 2013, there was only one – Zambia
- Undernourishment has dropped significantly. In 1945, around half the world’s population didn’t have enough to eat. Today, that’s been cut to around 10 percent.


### [[Improvements in sanitation and advances in medicine have dramatically increased life expectancy]].

- London-based physician John Snow, While mapping the spread of cholera, he realized that the main source was a company that collected water downstream from sewage outlets
- London quickly introduced sophisticated water systems and, eventually, chlorination and filtering
- Later still, garbage collection was introduced in cities around the world
- medicine switched to an evidence-based scientific approach. The result? Life expectancy saw a dramatic and, most importantly, _sustained_ rise for the first time in the history of the human species
- Globalization is an ally in the fight against human disease - more science info flow
- In the early decades of the last century, the average person could expect to live to 31. By 2015, the worldwide average was 71.
- That’s extraordinary when you consider that average life expectancy hovered around 30 years for the previous _eight thousand generations._

### [[People are wealthier than before and poverty rates have hit an all-time low]].
- Since the industrial age, we’ve experienced history’s largest increase in global wealth
- The average real earnings of English workers doubled between 1820 and 1850. Before the industrial age, it would have taken an average worker around two millennia to double his income!
- Japan saw its GDP increase by a factor of eleven after 1950. China increased by a factor of _twenty_
- In developing countries, the number of people living in extreme poverty fell from 53.9 percent in 1981 to 11.9 percent in 2015

### [[We live in one of the most peaceful eras in human history]].
- just because we have more media coverage today doesn't mean violence is also on the rise
- In fact, [[violence is _declining_]]
- Murder rates first started declining in Europe in the early modern era
- Centralized governments and modern legal systems were key to this transformation
- In the sixteenth century, for example, there were 19 murders per 100,000 people in Europe. Today, that’s dropped to 1 homicide per 100,000 citizens
- Wars between states now claim an average of 3,000 lives per conflict. In the 1950s, by comparison, the number of victims was closer to 86,000!

### [[The environment is also a beneficiary of greater global prosperity]].
- growth and environmental conservation aren’t mutually exclusive
- For three centuries, all the way up to the 1970s, London's pollution rose. But after that, it decreased sharply and returned to pre-industrial levels, due, in large part, to the development of cleaner technologies
- [[If you plot national wealth against environmental damage, you end up with a bell-shaped curve]]
- As countries first become more prosperous, damage to the environment increases. But when you reach the tip of the hump, the relationship reverses. Once a certain level of wealth has been reached, damage to the environment decreases
- [[Taking care of the environment becomes a priority once other, more basic needs have been met]]. Put differently, conservation becomes important only once you know that your family has enough to eat.

- [[Prosperity isn’t the problem; it’s the solution]]

### [[Education has improved dramatically around the globe over the last couple of centuries]]
- It’s hard to overstate just how important literacy is. Reading and writing expand people’s horizons and open new doors
- Once you’ve learned to read, it’s easier to stay informed and pick up new ideas
- Literacy is also vital when it comes to finding a decent job. Without it, it’s impossible to acquire new skills that are in demand on the labor market
- the road to global literacy is paved with higher incomes, peace and mass-literacy campaigns
- Two hundred years ago, roughly 12 percent of the world’s population knew how to read and write; as of 2015, only about 14 percent of the world population _couldn’t_ read or write
- the ratio of girls to boys enrolled in primary and secondary schools, as well as universities, is now almost equal
- In 1990, there were around eight girls in education for every ten boys. In most low- and middle-income countries today, the ratio is closer to 1:1

### [[The global rise of democracy and tolerance has resulted in greater individual freedom and more equal societies]].
- Two developments have expanded our personal and political freedoms: democratization and the global ban on slavery
- forced labor, forced marriage and human trafficking still exist – but they’re no longer defended as a matter of principle
- In 1900, there wasn’t a single electoral democracy in the world in which every man and woman could vote
- by 2000, around 58 percent of the world’s population lived in electoral democracies!
- Today, women are a firm fixture in the political institutions of virtually every nation except Saudi Arabia and the Vatican
- Before the twenty-first century, there were no countries in which same-sex partners could marry. Now, there are 21 nations where gay people can legally tie the knot

### Future generations will be well positioned to perpetuate the progress we’ve already made.
- younger generations will grow up in a world that’s richer, healthier and more tolerant than at any other time in history
- In seventeenth-century France during the reign of Louis XIV, for example, parents were fined if they didn’t send their children out to work
- the mid-nineteenth century, around 20 percent of all English and Welsh children had to work
- In Africa and Asia, some 40 percent of children were in employment in 1950. Today, below 10.
- The “[[skill premium]]” also plays a role in this. As it becomes possible to earn more by learning specialized skills, it makes more sense to invest in children’s futures by educating them

- [[Be skeptical of pessimists]]
- Populists and pessimists often claim that everything’s going to the dogs. But don’t be fooled – the world was a lot more dangerous, unpleasant and poorer yesterday than it is today
