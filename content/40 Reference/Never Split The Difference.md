- [[negotiation]] requires listening, making it about other people, emotion validation and creating trust & safety to enable real conversations
- use [[mirroring]] to encourage empathy and bonding. Keep people talking to buy time and learn their strategy
- [[tactical empathy]] highlights the emotional and other roadblocks to getting a deal done
- labelling - giving someone's emotion name - gets you closer to people in a safe way
- [[the power of no]] - eliminate options (good for both sides). makes the other person feel in control

- [[people want to be understood and accepted]]
- listening well is the best tool

### Chapter 2: Be a Mirror
- question your assumptions and assume you'll encounter surprises
- negotiation is not a battle of arguments, it is a discovery process
- the goal: get as much info as possible
	- what is their need and what do they *really* want?
- go slow
- [[The 3 voice tones]]:
1.  **The late-night FM DJ voice:** Use selectively - creates authority and trustworthiness without making people defensive
2.  **The positive/playful voice**: The default - light and encouraging
3.  **The direct or assertive voice:** Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.
- smile
- ok to be direct and succinct if you create safety
- turn your assumptions into hypotheses and test through the negotiation
- Mirroring - repeat the last 3 words (or the most critical 1-3)
	- we are drawn to what's similar
	- tricks the other person into thinking you're agreeing

To get your own way without confrontation, follow five simple steps:
1.  Use the late-night FM DJ voice;
2.  Start with “I’m sorry …”;
3.  Mirror;
4.  Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart; and
5.  Repeat.

### Chapter 3: Don’t Feel Their Pain, Label It
- [[neural resonance]] - observing facial cues, gestures and voice tone to think and feel like someone else
- 1st step to labelling is to detect emotional state
- watch the changes people undergo when you speak different words/phrases
- once you spot an emotion, label it aloud:
	-  “It _seems_ like …”
	- “It _sounds_ like …”
	- “It _looks_ like …”
- if they disagree, step back and say 'it just seemed like it'
- once you've thrown out a label, be silent and listen
- people’s emotions have two levels: the “presenting” behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the “underlying” feeling is what motivates the behavior.
- focus on the underlying - labelling bad things diffuses them and labelling good ones reinforces them
- labelling makes people acknowledge their feelings instead of continuing to act out
- labelling the bad is a fast and efficient way to move past it
- remove the barriers to get closer to a deal
- list the worst things the other party could say about you first

### Chapter 4: Beware “Yes”—Master “No”
- “No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it
	- It can mean:
		- I'm not ready to agree
		- I'm uncomfortable
		- I don't understand
		- it's too pricey
		- i need more info
		- i need to ask my wife

- Ask solution-based questions: 
	- “What about this doesn’t work for you?”
	- “What would you need to make it work?”

- The three kinds of “Yes”:
1.  Counterfeit;
2.  Confirmation; and
3.  Commitment.

- A counterfeit “yes” - plans on saying no and is buying time or evading the discussion
- A confirmation “yes” is generally innocent and reflexive 
- A commitment “yes” is the real deal;  a true agreement that leads to action

- the other party needs to feel equally responsible (or even solely responsible) for creating connection and sharing new ideas
- [[everyone want to feel safe, secure and in control]]

- [[cold calls]] tip:
	- "If you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or you get “No, it’s not” and total focus"

As you can see, “No” has a lot of skills:
-   “No” allows the real issues to be brought forth;
-   “No” protects people from making—and lets them correct—ineffective decisions;
-   “No” slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions
-   “No” helps people feel safe, secure, and in control
-   “No” moves everyone’s efforts forward.

- If the other party won’t say “No,” you’re dealing with people who are indecisive or confused or who have a hidden agenda
- you can try intentionally mislabeling them to compel the first no
- for being ignored: “Have you given up on this project?” works wonders.

### Chapter 5: Trigger The Two Words That Immediately Transform Any Negotiation
- strive for “That’s right.” iso yes as a response


### Chapter 6: Bend Their Reality
- The most powerful word in negotiations is “Fair.”
- you need to create a reputation for being fair
- to create [[leverage]] the other party needs to feel they have something to lose if the deal doesn't go through
- Here’s how:
**1. Anchor Their Emotions**
- acknowledge their fears and put them into [[loss aversion]] mode

**2. Let The Other Guy Go First … Most of The Time**
- let the other side anchor monetary negotiations
- could end up lucky with higher offer than expected
- don't let them extreme anchor and bend your reality
 
**3. Establish a Range**
- state a range around your target price instead of a target price

**4. Pivot to Non-Monetary Terms**
- bends their reality to things other than money
- if the anchor is high for you, then you offer things
- if the anchor is low for you, then offer them things

**5. When You Do Talk Numbers, Use Odd Ones**
- numbers ending in 0 feel like placeholders
- $37,263—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of a thoughtful calculation

**6. Surprise with a Gift**

You can get your counterpart into a mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor and then, after their inevitable first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated surprise gift.

**How to Negotiate a Better Salary**

_i. Be Pleasantly Persistent on Non-Salary Terms_ i.e. more vacation
_ii. Salary Terms without Success Terms is Russian Roulette_
_iii. Spark Their Interest in Your Success and Gain an Unofficial Mentor_

- sell yourself as a way for the manager to express their own intelligence

**- [[Don’t compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides]]**

- [[deadlines]] encourage people to rush against their best interests
- The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don’t get suckered into a concession
- You can bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring his starting point
- [[People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain]]
	- not sure if I agree when it comes to investing


### Chapter 7: Create the Illusion of Control
- “How am I supposed to do that?”
- A calibrated question to use when the offer is not good for you
- [[calibrated questions]] have the power to educate your counterpart on what the problem is rather than causing conflict by telling them what the problem is
- use them early and often
- Examples:
-   What about this is important to you?
-   How can I help to make this better for us?
-   How would you like me to proceed?
-   What is it that brought us into this situation?
-   How can we solve this problem?
-   What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
- these make the other party feel like they're in charge
- you need to keep your emotions in check to win
	- bite your tongue
- avoid questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or a few simples. encourage [[Elaboration]]
**- Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language**


### Chapter 8: Guarantee Execution
- you need to be a [[decision architect]] - steer the negots to attain consent and execution
- [[“Yes” is nothing without “How.”]]
- "How" questions are gentle ways to say "No" and steer the convo
- “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?” 
	- When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in
- “You’re right,” is bad. "That's right" is good
- [[“I’ll try,” means, “I plan to fail.”]]

**i. The 7-38-55 Percent Rule**
- Albert Mehrabian created [[the 7-38-55 rule]]
- That is, only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face
	- no alignment = potential for lies

**ii. The Rule of Three**
- getting agreement to the same thing 3x  in a conversation
- 1st yes - agreement 2nd - use labelling 3rd - via calibrated question

**iii. The Pinocchio Effect**
- liars use more words and more 3rd-person pronouns (him,her etc.)
- this attempts to confuse and put distance between people
- called [[the pinocchio effect]] as more words = bigger lie
- used 1st person (names) to be truthful

**iv. The Chris Discount**
- use your name so the other party's name isn't overused

**How to Get Your Counterparts to Bid Against Themselves**
- say no using How questions
- do it 4 times
1. “How am I supposed to do that?”
2. “Your offer is very generous, I’m sorry, that just doesn’t work for me” 
3. “I’m sorry but I’m afraid I just can’t do that.”
4. "No" with a downward inflection and a tone of regard

### Chapter 9: Bargain Hard
- when being compelling to haggle:  “Let’s put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal.” Or “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?” 
- trying to steal a client: “Why would you ever do business with me? Why would you ever change from your existing supplier? They’re great!” 
- [[Once you’re clear on what your bottom line is, you have to be willing to walk away]]
- The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is

**The Ackerman Model**
- offer-counteroffer
1.  Set your target price
2.  make first offer at 65 percent of your target price
3.  Calculate 3 raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent)
4.  Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer
5.  When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers
6.  On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don’t want)

 - Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style:  Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst

### **Chapter 10: Find [[The Black Swan**]]
- every case is new. We must let what we know—our known knowns—guide us but not blind us to what we do not know
- always be aware who has the most to lose at any given time
- 3 kinds of leverage: Positive, Negative, and Normative
	- Positive leverage - your ability to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants
	- Negative leverage - your ability to make your counterpart suffer
	- Normative leverage - show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions
- asked what they believe and listen openly. You want to see what language they speak and speak it back to them
"My opponent is crazy" reasons people think this:
**Mistake #1: They Are Ill-Informed**
- people operating with incomplete information appear crazy to those who have different information.
- determine what they don't know and supply the info

**Mistake #2: They Are Constrained**
- In any negotiation where your counterpart is acting wobbly, there exists a distinct possibility that they have things they can’t do but aren’t eager to reveal.

**Mistake #3: They Have Other Interests**
- they have with needs and desires that you don’t yet understand

- Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the 3 types of leverage
- Work to understand the other side’s “religion.” 
- Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table
- Exploit the [[similarity principle]]. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with
