- The personal development conversation - welcome feedback ongoing

- As you rise, soft skill importance eclipses hard skills


### **CHAPTER 5 Secure Early Wins**
- If poss, early wins should benefit longer term goals
- conceptualize [[waves of change]]
	- each wave should have phases
	- learn, design, lobby, implement, observe
	- each wave has a goal
	- 1st - early wins, 2nd - strategy, systems & skills
- avoid early losses, tough to recover when tide is against you
- read: [[Warrent Buffet - don't lose money]]
- Where to look for early wins:

    -   Focus early on rites of passage

    -   **Focused but flexible.**
    -   **Active without causing commotion**

	- for elements of org arch:
		- strategic direction
		- structure
		- core processes
		- skill bases
- create clear lines of accountability
- keep it simple
- [[From SWOT to TOWS]]: The correct approach is to start with the environment (threats & opportunities) and then analyze the organization (strengths & weaknesses).
-   Structure consists ofs:
    -   Units: How your direct reports are grouped; by function, product, or geographical area
    -   Reporting relationships and integration mechanisms:
    -   Decision rights and rules: Performance measurement and incentive systems
-   To evaluate the effectiveness of each core process, you should examine:
    -   Productivity
    -   Timeliness
    -   Reliability
    -   Quality

### **CHAPTER 7 Build Your Team**
- **The most important decisions you make in your first 90 days will probably be about people**.
- Related [[Your People Strategy]]
-   Avoiding Common Traps
    -   Criticizing the previous leadership.
    -   Keeping the existing team too long.
    -   Not balancing stability and change.
    -   Not working on organizational alignment and team development in parallel.
    -   Not holding on to the good people.
    -   Undertaking team building before the core is in place.
    -   Making implementation-dependent decisions too early.
    -   Trying to do it all yourself.
-   Assessing Your Team
    -   Establish Your Evaluative Criteria across: Competence; Judgment; Energy; Focus; Relationships; Trust.
-   Evolving Your Team – By the end of roughly the first 30 days, you should be able to provisionally assign people to one of the following categories
    -   Keep in place.
    -   Keep and develop.
    -   Move to another position.
    -   Replace (low priority).
    -   Replace (high priority).
    -   Observe for a while.
- **Above all, take care to live the vision you articulate.**
- **Different types of decisions call for different decision-making processes, but most team leaders stick with one approach (esp. consultative decision making).**
- **If the decision is likely to be highly divisive — creating winners and losers — then you usually are better off using consult-and-decide and taking the heat.**
- **If the decision requires energetic support for implementation from people whose performance you cannot adequately observe and control, then you usually are better off using a build-consensus process.**
- **Don’t engage in a charade of consensus building — an effort to build support for a decision already made.**

### **CHAPTER 8 Create Alliances**
- create relationship bank accounts you will need to work with later
- Related [[Sullenberger - Big Withdrawal]]
-   To succeed in your new role, you will need the support of people over whom you have no direct authority.
-   Discipline yourself to invest in building up “relationship bank accounts “with people you anticipate needing to work with later.
-   Understand the Influence Landscape — a sort of shadow organization.
- It also pays to think hard about potential blocking alliances — those who collectively have the power to say no.
- Identify Supporters, Opponents, and Persuadables
    -   **Be careful not to assume that people are adversaries. When you meet resistance, probe for the reasons behind it
- Understanding people’s motivations is only part of the story. You also need to assess situational pressures
- Armed with deeper insight into the people you need to influence, you can think about how to apply techniques such as consultation, framing, choice-shaping, social influence, incrementalism, sequencing, and action-forcing events

### **CHAPTER 9 Manage Yourself**
- say no to things
	- easy to say yes later, hard to say no later
- build a [[network of trusted advisers]] within and outside the organization 
	- need 3 types of advisors: technical, cultural, political
