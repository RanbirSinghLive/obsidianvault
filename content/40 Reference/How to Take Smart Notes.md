Writing is not a linear process but a circular one.

Multitasking is not a good idea.

[[The Exposure Effect]] = mixing up be familiar with something with being skilled at it

[[Feedback Loops]]

The mind is reliant on external scaffolding - ch 28

[[Memory]]: storage strength vs retrieval strength

[[Zettelkasten]] is something to think in, not think about.

Steve Jobs - [[creativity is just connecting things]]

Indifference is the worst environment for insight.


-  [[Niklas Luhmann]] created the [[Zettelkasten]] technique
- Zettelkasten created a inter-connected, cross-topic note collection
- It is only guided by your own knowledge and interests
- This is against the modular, top-down approach used in a university [[curriculum]]
- Related [[Secret Semester]]
- **Students are not encouraged to create their own connections between diverse topics, despite all the work that's been done on how our memory and capacity for learning actually works**	
- The goal is now to learn for the long-run and make creating easier


### **How We Should Learn**
- **Elaboration**: connecting an idea to prior knowledge and trying to comprehend it's greater significance
- **Retrieval**: Deliberately retrieving past ideas
- **Spacing**: Retrieving past ideas are different times
- **Variation**: Retrieving past ideas in different contexts
- **Contextual Interference**: Having past ideas come up by chance in other contexts


#### **Elaboration:**
- This is the best method
- This is simply thinking hard about what you're reading and how it can connect to disparate things.

#### **Meaningful Connections:**
- Connect new info to as many meaningful places as possible
- "If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn.”

#### **Storage Strength & Retrieval Strength:**
- Storage strength - the ability to store memories. Grows as you get older. 
- Retrieval strength - the ability to build connections between memories
- Retrieval should be much more important, to help with emergence
- Current [[school]]ing focuses largely on storage strength **which cannot be improved upon**
	- Futile to remember isolated facts

#### **Writing as Thinking:**
- Writing is the best aid in thinking and learning and generating content ideas
- Notes accumulate while you think, so have a 'pen in hand' while you read
- Taking smart notes will propel you forward
- Writing does not come after research, learning or studying. It is the medium all that work is composed in
- Write to achieve insight, not proclaim opinions
- Thinking & Reading is the main work, not writing
	- Notes are just the outcome of thinking & reading

### **The Zettelkasten (Strategically)**
- You need a system to manage your growing pool of notes
- The goal o the system is combining ideas to create new ones
- Related [[Steal Like An Artist]]
- The Zettelkasten centralizes the work instead of the learner
	- It allows the learner's thinking to become decentralized
- It is not a box but a garden. Things mingle
	**- It's usability should grow with it's size**
	- Interconnectedness will provide us with lines of developed ideas
- Looking through a Zettel will emerge related notes we weren't thinking of
- Ideas form clusters overtime, which then also interconnect
- A growing Zettel will lead to [[compound growth]]/interest

### **The Zettelkasten  (Tactically)**

- Workflow > Mindset

#### **1. Your Inbox:** capture _[[Fleeting Notes]]_ in your head
- Should not require thought or multiple steps
- Ensure everything ends up in one place
- Process within a day
 

#### **2. Reference Slip-Box:** for bibliographical references & [[literature notes]]
- Notes should be very short, extremely selective, and use your own words

#### **3. Main Slip-Box:** collect & generate ideas with _[[Permanent Notes]]_
- Process fleeting and lit notes and think **how they relate to your own research**
- Write down one idea per note
- Link to existing nows
- File the note


#### **4. [[Project]]-Specific Folder:** temporary for each project
- **Project notes:** Only relevant to one particular project and can be written in any format. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished
- A Zettel is best when working on multiple projects at once
- It becomes, what  what the chemical industry calls ‘[[verbund]].’ 
	- This is when the output of one factory line becomes the resource for another line
	- That line produces by-products for other lines
	- This network of production lines is far superior to isolated lines

### **Internal Brain _and_ External Brain**
- The Zettel becomes an external brain, and does things your internal brain can't
- It becomes long-term memory of facts
- Your brain summarizes and dives deeper alternatively

#### **Your Internal Brain:**
- We can learn more when we connect it to existing knowledge
- This is where mental models help
- Zettel helps not to overload our small short-term memory
-  "**We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two**.”
- **The Zeigarnik Effect:** - to-do items occupy short-term memory until they are done
- This is why tasks distract us
- Writing down tasks externally is an alternate way to free our minds of them
- This is the [[Getting Things Done]] secret - get things out of short term memory

#### **Your External Brain:**
- We need external scaffolding that compensates for the limitations of our brains
- “Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from **the main work, which here is _thinking_**. The slip-box provides an **external scaffold to think in** and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.”

#### **Internal Brain + External Brain = Latticework of Mental Models:**
- Need both to be productive
- [[Charlie Munger]] says to look for most potent concepts in every discipline and make them part of our thinking. Once we start combining these, we end up with [[Worldly Wisdom]]
- Creating a broad range of [[mental models]] in your head
	- The opposite is being too attached to 1-2 and biasing your thinking
- If your thoughts don't work in models, they aren't usable - Munger
- If we use the Zettel as our mental model, we co-evolve with it
	- We enter a [[virtuous cycle]] that facilities learning and growth
- The Zettel stores info so you can focus on thinking and understanding
- The process is two-way - your notes are shaped by your mental models and your mental models determine what you read to make notes on
- The Zettel becomes an [[idea generator]]

### **Nurturing a Virtuous Circle [[Workflow]] with Smart Notes**
- positive experiences from a workflow encourage us to take on the next task
**- The goal: streamline everything towards insight that can be published**
- Follow your own curiosity and interests
- Read more - to challenge and strengthen ideas
- The skill to filter information by relevance is a learned skill that can only be learned by more reading
- Take more notes
- Use the Zettel
- **Develop arguments and ideas [[bottom-up]] instead of top-down**
- “In reality, **you never work on just one idea, but many ideas in different stages at the same time**."
- Make a rough draft
- Edit and Proof
- Publish!
- **“To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, **all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read**.”**
