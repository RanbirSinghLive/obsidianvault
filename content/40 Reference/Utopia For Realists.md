### 1 – The present world ought to be a heaven, yet it’s leaving us unusually disappointed.  
- for most of human history, life was “poor, dreadful, brutish, and short.” [[Thomas Hobbes]] ^43c26e
- the normal Italian earned around $1,600 in the year 1300. After six centuries, Galileo, Newton, the Enlightenment, the creation of printing, the steam motor, and black powder...  Still $1,600!
- Things are currently moving so quick that the cost of a solitary watt of sun based power has dropped by 99 percent since 1980
- we’re additionally more secure – the homicide rate in Western Europe, is an entire multiple times lower than in the Middle Ages, smallpox has been killed, and today, in light of the fact that less infection implies less early passings, the normal future on the African landmass is developing at a pace of four days consistently.   
- we are living in heaven. So why are such huge numbers of individuals still disappointed with their part?   
- The minute has come to consider again what progress and carrying on with a decent life in a period of material riches truly implies.   

## 2 – [[Giving free cash to individuals is a surprisingly successful method for improving their lives]]
- GiveDirectly pursues a straightforward guideline: Cash-destitute individuals know superior to any other person what they need. In this way, the most ideal approach to help them is to give them cash
- An MIT investigation of GiveDirectly’s money awards found that they drive an enduring 38 percent expansion in earnings and lift home and domesticated animal possession by 58 percent. 
- destitution isn’t about ineptitude, apathy or terrible choices. It’s about an absence of cash

### 3 – The minute for actualizing a Universal Basic Income has come
- [[Universal Basic Income]], or UBI, is an array where everybody gets simply enough cash to live on. It’s assessment supported, given unequivocally, and doesn’t require the beneficiary to work
- beneficiaries of a UBI in the United States had the option to settle on reasonable choices, such as putting resources into training, instead of choices controlled by financial situation and need.  

### 4 – [[Gross domestic product]] is an unreasonable and obsolete method for estimating progress; it needs supplanting.  
- GDP should never again be trusted as a measuring stick for a country’s advancement
- Right off the bat, GDP makes an awful showing of estimating innovative advances. That is incomplete because items that are free or modest can transformatively affect business or society however in any case hurt GDP
- The vast majority of us would respect the free calling app Skype, for instance, as speaking to advance. In any case, it cost the telecom mammoths a fortune, and along these lines gouged GDP
- Also, GDP profits by human torment. While the 2011 seismic tremor and tidal wave that left 20,000 dead in Japan harmed GDP that year, the ensuing recuperation endeavors helped the economy. Subsequently, GDP developed to 1 percent in 2012, rising still in 2013. Things being what they are, are tidal waves useful for the economy? The improving GDP would propose so.   
- The King of Bhutan broadly did a change to a gross national bliss measure that joined a more extensive appraisal of society’s wellbeing, similar to the learning of conventional melodies and moves
- One other factor that our dashboard could quantify is recreation time. Since, as we’ll currently observe, time is additionally something to be esteemed.   

### 5 – We should grasp the bunch advantages of a 15-hour working week.  
- [[John Maynard Keynes]] said by 2030, immense financial development would mean a 15-hour week’s worth of work
- Henry Ford, found that shortening his representatives’ week’s worth of work expanded their efficiency.   
- However, by the 1980s, decreases in working hours halted
-  when analysts in the United States asked individuals whether they would prefer to have an additional two weeks’ compensation or an additional two weeks off, twice the same number of picked the leisure time
- What’s more, working less has horde benefits, from lessening mishaps in the working environment to cutting feelings of anxiety, to freeing ladies. Nations with the most limited work filled weeks top sex equity rankings. Why? All things considered, when men work less, they get a greater amount of [[unpaid work]] at home that has customarily been left to ladies.

### 6 – How we organize which employments are lofty or generously compensated is all off-base.  
- two days after New York’s sanitation workforce took to the streets, the city was knee-somewhere down in smelling reject. Just because since a 1931 polio flare-up, the city announced a highly sensitive situation. It turns out you truly need trash collectors; shouldn’t something be said about stock brokers? 
- A useful money related framework developed, and by November 1970, £5 billion in natively constructed cash had been printed and utilized. It worked out that some type of money related framework was required, yet investors themselves? Not really
- Certain employments bring riches and renown, such as being a broker, a superstar legal counselor or an online networking strategist. Others, such as being a junk jockey or a common teacher, are seriously paid and bring either no glory or by and large scorn. Be that as it may, actually, numerous as far as anyone knows superstar employments make little riches.   
- Take legal counselors. Without a doubt, the standard of law is significant. In any case, the United States has 17 fold the number of legal counselors per individual as Japan. Is America’s legitimate framework multiple times better? No


### 7 – Our economy is in a general sense changing, and innovation represents a more prominent risk to occupations than at any other time.  
- Since the beginning, individuals have cautioned on the effect of machines on occupations. In any case, today, a great many people would state that the Luddites and other dread mongers failed to understand the situation. All things considered, we aren’t all jobless. Regardless, there are motivations to be more stressed than any other time in recent memory about the effect of innovation on employment
- [[automation]]
- One explanation is the sheer pace of innovative change. Think about Moore’s law, which expresses that the quantity of transistors on every PC chip pairs year on year, thus does processing power as an outcome. When Gordon Moore, an IBM prime supporter, found this development design during the 1960s, there were only 30 transistors to a chip.   
- Indeed, when the Xbox One was propelled in 2013, it had five billion transistors. Moore’s law isn’t giving any indications of backing off, and a few pundits expect amazing advances in PC innovation soon.   
- A second motivation behind why our economy is on a very basic level changing is that mechanical development and globalization imply that minor gatherings of individuals would now be able to fabricate immeasurably fruitful organizations
**- In the late 1980s, Kodak utilized 145,000 individuals. It declared financial insolvency in 2012, that year that Instagram was offered to Facebook for $1 billion. Instagram’s workforce? Thirteen individuals.**   

### 8 – We can either utilize the duty to redistribute the abundance of the coming machine age or slide into ever-more prominent disparity.  
- It appears to be conceivable that the Luddites’ enemy of innovation fears wasn’t right, however maybe only somewhat untimely; perhaps we truly are bound to be beaten in our race against the machine. All things considered, we might be going to arrive at a tipping point in which advancements in figuring power and man-made reasoning drastically make a huge difference
- The appropriate response lies in dismissing a focal fundamental of present-day life: the possibility that we should all work professionally. At last, the appropriate response is enormous redistribution.   

### 9 – On the off chance that we truly need to utilize our riches to assemble a utopia, [[we have to open up the world’s borders]].  
- Envision there was a solitary measure that wouldn’t simply enhance destitution yet kill it? What’s more, envision that measure would make us all more extravagant, too? Without a doubt we’d take it, isn’t that so?   
- All things considered, shockingly, we presumably wouldn’t. Not at this moment. Since that measure is to open all borders.   
- Market analysts’ perspectives on this are reliable. As per a Center for Global Development paper, four significant investigations anticipated worldwide financial development of somewhere in the range of 67 and 147 percent if borders were opened.   
- So for what reason don’t we open up? Indeed, national outskirts appear to twist our reasoning. We are ethically irate to discover that white Americans procure more than dark Americans, however we don’t flutter an eyelid at the information that an American will, for a similar work, acquire multiple times in excess of a Bolivian of a similar age and capacities, and eight and a half times more than the proportional Nigerian.  
- Also, somebody procuring a middle pay in the United States is in the most extravagant 4 percent. That is in the wake of changing for the average cost for basic items. Today, the worldwide elite are scarcely mindful of its karma.
