- To get rich, give society what it doesn't yet know how to attain
- **Nailing down that 'it'** is tough if the customer doesn't know what it is
	- It is usually in Tech, based on history
- The 'it' will come from [[specific knowledge]] - something only you personally know
- That specific knowledge will come from [[passion]] and [[geniune curiosity]]
- This allows you to be the only one who can deliver this product and eliminates the prospect of competition
- [[escape competition through authenticity]]
- **Build a [[Personal Brand]]**
	- The Single Name Test - Oprah, Trump, Buffet, Elon
- The risk with brand is [[accountability]]
- **[[Leverage]]**
- Find the multiplier effect for your work
- Humans are not evolved to understand leverage. we think 1-to-1
	- Different types of leverage
		- Labour
		- Capital
		- Code
		- Content
- The last 2 (code, content) are permissionless
- **Stay on the bleeding edge of trends**
- **Build your brand in the meantime on social media**
- **Strike when the time is right with maximum leverage**
