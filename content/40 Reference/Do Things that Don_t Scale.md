[[Paul Graham]] works at [[Y Combinator]].

[[Startups]] succeed or fail based on the work if the founders, not on the value of the product.

**To succeed, do things that larger companies cannot do due to their size.**

## [[Getting Customers]]
Stripe went out of its way to be 'aggressive' with recruiting new users. Instead of sending people links if they were interested, they would ask the interested party for their laptop and get Stripe set up right then.

AirBNB initially went door to door to get new listings for their sire.

Focus on weekly growth rate of customers in percentage terms. This way the smaller numbers don't seem so insignificant. Hopefully you will better envision the [[compound growth]]

## Customer Satisfaction
Wufoo sent new customers written thank you notes.
Startups struggle when people focus on their technical skills vs customer service see: [[The E-Myth Revisited]]
Startups also worry these tactics won't scale. Worry about that when it's actually a problem. 
People haven't been treated well by businesses so this influences them when they start their own.

**Make up the difference from delivering an incomplete, buggy product with attentiveness**

## [[Niche]]

Picking a market subset can allow you to tailor your experience and product for them, allowing a quicker adoption as nothing can complete for those few 100 or 1000s of people.

## Going Manual
Sometimes you can get away with doing things manually as a part of your product that you plan on automating later.

Don't worry about making a big launch. Your startup is an aircraft, not a missile
