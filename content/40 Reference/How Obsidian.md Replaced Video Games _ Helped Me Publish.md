[[Gamification]] through note-taking in Obsidian. What Eleanor enjoyed the most about the video games she played (simulators, RPGs) was managing inventory and tweaking automations. This translates well to tending notes or optimizing templates.

She uses tags to manage workflow through her processing process (heh).

People sell serialized fiction on [[Substack]] these days, instead of the old days of horrendous luck trying to monetize short fiction.
