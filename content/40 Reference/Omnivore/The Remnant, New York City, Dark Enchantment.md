## Highlights

> Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. They tend to take the same route to and from work, interact with the same social circles, and talk to the same types of people at parties. In contrast, lucky people tend to introduce lots of variety into their lives.

Relatedly, as [Ada Yeo](https://open.substack.com/users/74564383-ada-yeo?utm%5Fsource=mentions) [writes](https://substack.com/redirect/b136b710-6ca5-4dad-b6f4-98d5b733443b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ), “collect as many lottery tickets as you can.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-remnant-new-york-city-dark-enchantment-190dfe25596#6c93a209-c4e7-4a85-bd4b-04b4e9d93a3b) 

> Americans are famous for displays of clear emotional expressions. This is common in countries with long histories of migration. When your neighbor doesn't share your culture, emotions serve as a common ground. In such societies, clear expression is critical for being understood.

> Mao Zedong, communist leader and founder of the People's Republic of China, in 1969: “I like to deal with rightists. They say what they really think—not like the leftists, who say one thing and mean another.” ([source](https://substack.com/redirect/2bad4a53-f378-4c7c-9078-12d20073bca8?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ)).
