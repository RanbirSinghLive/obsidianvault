## Highlights

> Coastal Gas, MeToo, Black Lives Matter, trans issues, COVID, anti-COVID, Ukraine, now Israel. Others have recently labelled it “[The Omnicause](https://medium.com/news-and-narrative/the-omnicause-unraveling-the-essence-of-modern-protest-movements-01bb3db13093).” Social activism that is ever present.
