## Highlights

> I’ve always thought Twitter makes you twice as informed but half as productive. On net it’s probably a wash. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/information-that-would-get-your-attention-collab-fund-18d6e577492#f7dc6038-307b-43b0-8c2d-9ae072047d72) 

> I met someone a few years ago. When we parted ways he said, “Life is long. I hope we stay in touch.”

> Life is long. No one says that. They always say, “life is short.” But obviously it could be either. We have no idea.

> The “life is short” philosophy says don’t wait, go have fun, live a great life – eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. If your life were shorter than you expected, nearly everyone would follow that advice. You’d also be likely to forgive, forget, and not be bothered by petty annoyances, realizing that with your limited time to enjoy good stuff there’s no use being held back by dumb stuff. You’d appreciate every sunset, smell the flowers, and call an old friend. You wouldn’t miss a single of your kids’ little league games. Part of the reason Lyndon Johnson had so much energy and ambition is because he always feared he’d die young.

> What about the “life is long” philosophy? If you knew you’d live to 101 years old, you probably wouldn’t feel as rushed. You’d be less anxious about your career. You wouldn’t feel guilty sleeping in, taking a sabbatical, or using all of your vacation pay. You’d plant trees to watch them grow and take more pictures to remember. You’d be more willing to learn a new skill. You’d take better care of your joints, and long-term investing would be more exciting.

> Unlike Twitter, it might make you twice as informed and twice as productive. Now that would get your attention. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/information-that-would-get-your-attention-collab-fund-18d6e577492#27d648b6-e3cd-4a95-9421-a448da5462c7)
