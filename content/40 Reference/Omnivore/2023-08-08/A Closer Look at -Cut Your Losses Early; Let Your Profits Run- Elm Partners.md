## Highlights

> In the chart below, we see how a CLE-LPR strategy would have fared if applied to US stock market investing over roughly the past 100 years. It shows historical returns of investing in the S&amp;P500 index with a CLE-LPR strategy versus a static weight (70% stocks/30% T-bills) portfolio of equal risk. For the dynamic strategy, we sell our S&amp;P 500 long position and invest in T-Bills as soon as the trailing 12-month return drops below -5%, stay out of the market for at least three months, and reinstate the long as soon as the 12-month return is better than -5%.
> 
> This approach means losses are cut early, while a profitable position is held as long as it keeps going up. The CLE-LPR strategy generated a 1.4% higher annual return over the period with the same risk measured as standard deviation of daily returns, and roughly the same average exposure to the stock market of 70%.[4](#easy-footnote-bottom-4-8965) This translates into a 25% higher Sharpe Ratio for the dynamic strategy than for the static stock/T-bill portfolio (0.53 vs. 0.43).
> 
> Also, the Cut-Losses-Early-and-Let-Profits-Run strategy outperformed the static portfolio during the two worst market sell-offs in 1929-32 and 2007-09, when the static portfolio’s max drawdowns were 70% and 41% respectively while the CLE-LPR largest drops during the same crises were 42% and 21%.

> Most people are naturally inclined to patiently, and painfully, stick with losing decisions for too long while cashing out of winning decisions too quickly. Indeed, this was an early finding in the field of behavioral economics, and was important enough to be given a name: the “Disposition Effect.”[14](#easy-footnote-bottom-14-8965) It is often the case that controlling our natural instincts can be rewarding. We suspect that much of the power of cutting losses quickly and letting profits run, at least when it comes to investing, lies in the difficulty of overcoming our propensity to do the exact opposite.
