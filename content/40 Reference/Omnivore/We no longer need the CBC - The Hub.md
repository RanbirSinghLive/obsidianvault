## Highlights

> This past weekend, I was a [guest](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-13-cross-country-checkup/clip/16011504-does-canada-still-need-public-broadcaster) on the CBC’s weekly call-in show, Cross Country Checkup, to discuss and debate the question: do we still need the CBC?

> a conservative concern that in a world of growing fragmentation and diversity, there are few sources of common citizenship and identity in Canada and the risk is a gradual drift from what Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has [referred](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/jonathan-sacks-society-is-not-a-house-or-a-hotel-it-should-be-a-home-223850.html) to as a “home society” to a “hotel society.” That is to say, in an absence of common stories and shared understandings of ourselves and the country, the danger is that we devolve into a loose collection of individuals merely living in the same geography.
