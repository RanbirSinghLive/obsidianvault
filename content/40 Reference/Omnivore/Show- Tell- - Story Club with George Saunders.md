## Highlights

> lovely quote from the Irish writer John McGahern on this subject: “I think that all bad writing is judgement and statement and that all good writing, in some way or other, is suggestion. Because you leave the characters alone and through the suggestions and the images, their completed life is in the reader’s mind…and consequently, there are as many versions of the novel as it has readers."
