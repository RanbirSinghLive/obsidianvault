## Highlights

> Many novelists have had the experience of being approached by someone convinced that they have a great idea for a novel, which they are willing to share in exchange for a fifty-fifty split of the proceeds. Such a person inadvertently reveals that they think formulating sentences is a nuisance rather than a fundamental part of storytelling in prose. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-a-i-isn-t-going-to-make-art-the-new-yorker-191d485712e#f6faed7b-f135-483a-b775-e31c5a685880) 

> We are entering an era where someone might use a large language model to generate a document out of a bulleted list, and send it to a person who will use a large language model to condense that document into a bulleted list. Can anyone seriously argue that this is an improvement? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-a-i-isn-t-going-to-make-art-the-new-yorker-191d485712e#cacc38ae-7477-41b0-b14e-0cf4495fd686) 

> Something similar holds true for art. Whether you are creating a novel or a painting or a film, you are engaged in an act of communication between you and your audience. What you create doesn’t have to be utterly unlike every prior piece of art in human history to be valuable; the fact that you’re the one who is saying it, the fact that it derives from your unique life experience and arrives at a particular moment in the life of whoever is seeing your work, is what makes it new. We are all products of what has come before us, but it’s by living our lives in interaction with others that we bring meaning into the world. That is something that an auto-complete algorithm can never do, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
