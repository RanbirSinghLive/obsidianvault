## Highlights

> Jane is tempted. No one in the world cares for her except those at Thornfield Hall, and choosing against it would almost certainly set her up for a life of loneliness. As she goes through this internal dialogue, a reply pierces her thoughts.
> 
> > _I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man … Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/mitt-romney-is-uncool-that-s-why-people-respect-him-18fd04c805a#e0aabf26-9c87-4585-8f88-c3994f5345bc) 

> Once Romney retires, a certain era of American politics will end. After John McCain died in the summer of 2018, the membership of the Lonely Republicans Club™ — the unofficial organization of elder statesmen who espoused the values of conservative governance without the flashiness and unpredictability of the modern GOP — was cut in half. Former and honorary members like Harry Reid, Jeff Flake and Liz Cheney have either died, given up on the race, been voted out, or have been ideologically captured.
