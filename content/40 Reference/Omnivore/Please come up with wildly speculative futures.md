## Highlights

> “One of the major differences between philosophers and the general public is that most people find it extremely difficult to discuss any controversial moral or political issue without getting upset. Philosophers, on the other hand, typically draw a distinction between entertaining a proposition and affirming it, and so assume that one should be able to debate various questions in a hypothetical register, without triggering any of the emotional reactions that might be appropriate if one actually held them.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/please-come-up-with-wildly-speculative-futures-18e9aeca5ba#68493f05-eee5-492c-8362-9bb0fb71b9c5)
