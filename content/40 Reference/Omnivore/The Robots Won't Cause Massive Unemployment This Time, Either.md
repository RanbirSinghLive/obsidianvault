## Highlights

> A [1993 paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118400) by (eventual Nobel prize-winning) economist Michael Kremer makes an important point about the tasks that make up many jobs: their effect on overall job performance is _multiplicative_, not additive. In other words, job performance is _not_ the average of performance on all the tasks. The boss doesn’t say “OK, you did 19 of the 20 tasks at 99%, but totally screwed up the 20th. No problem! Your overall performance is still 94%. Here’s a sweet raise.” 
> 
> In many if not most cases, the boss is much more likely to concentrate on that one screwed-up task, for good reason: “What do you mean you didn’t notice that two pages were missing!!?!? The client is furious with us and refusing to pay. I’m kinda feeling the same about you, to be honest” In such cases getting a zero on one of the tasks means getting a zero on the whole job, no matter how well the rest of the work went[3](https://geekway.substack.com/p/the-robots-wont-cause-massive-unemployment?r=e77za&triedRedirect=true#footnote-3-145760065). Kremer called this the “O-Ring” model of production because of of the Space Shuttle Challenger, the many components of which all performed well on a 1986 mission except for an O-ring that failed 73 seconds after launch. This failure caused a cascade of increasingly bad things to happen, culminating in the disintegration of the shuttle itself and the deaths of the seven astronauts on board.
> 
> One implication of O-Ring style jobs is that all of their tasks have to be done well. Another is that if performance on a bunch of the tasks suddenly gets better, the remaining tasks don’t become less important. Instead, they become more critical. 
> 
> To see why this is, consider an O-Ring job comprising 10 tasks. At one point in time, all ten are done by humans at the 0.8 level. The overall performance of the job is thus 0.8^10, or 0.1073, which sounds low. 
> 
> Raising the performance of just one of the tasks doesn’t help much at this point. If one goes from 0.8 all the way up to 0.99, overall perforance rises, but only to 0.132\. Hooray.
> 
> Now let’s say sophisticated automation appears that can bring performance on nine out of the ten tasks up to 0.99\. Then overall performance is 0.99^9\*.08, or .730\. This is a BIG improvement, but note that overall job performance is still below performance on _any_ of the component tasks. 90% of the job’s tasks are clicking along at 99%, yet the overall job is still still below 75%. 
> 
> The obvious smart move at this point is to upskill the person doing that one remaining unautomated task, or find someone who can do it better. If you can find someone who does that task at the .9 level, overall job performance rises to 0.99^9\*0.9, or .822\. And if you can find someone whose performance matches that of the automation, then you’re looking at 0.99^10, or .904 performance. 
> 
> In this job’s high automation scenario, then, any rational employer would be willing to pay a lot to find the person who can do that unautomated task at the .99 level — the translator, for example, who was observant enough to notice the missing pages. So even though translation has become an automated process, the human translator has become more valuable. This is not a purely hypothetical example. As Planet Money writes about Duolingo, “The company also uses human translators to ensure consistency in the company’s style and tone throughout their app. Turns out, AI can’t consistently master “the same playful voice” Duolingo wants to communicate to users. So, for that, von Ahn says, “we still employ humans.”” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-geekway-p-the-robots-wont-cause-mass-19079f7a94f#ef098470-489f-4c1d-9fcf-9d43eb2771a2)
