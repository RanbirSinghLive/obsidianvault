## Highlights

> it’s called Pournelle’s Iron Law of Bureaucracy and it applies everywhere. Pournelle’s Law states that ‘in any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals that the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence or are eliminated entirely’. Bureaucracies hence grow in a way analogous to cancers, which occur whenever the reproductive interests of a tumour contrive to diverge from the interests of the organism sustaining it.
