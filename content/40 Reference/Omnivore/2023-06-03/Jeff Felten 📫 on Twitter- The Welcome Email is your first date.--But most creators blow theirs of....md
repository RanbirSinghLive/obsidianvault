## Highlights

> Your welcome email SHOULD: ‚Ä¢ Set expectations ‚Ä¢ Start a conversation ‚Ä¢ Position you as trusted leader It should NOT: ‚Ä¢ Sell ‚Ä¢ Ramble on ‚Ä¢ Talk about yourself üëá
> 
> Consider how you‚Äôd treat a first date. - You don‚Äôt assume - You want to earn trust - You just want to get to date 2! Now‚Ä¶let‚Äôs get into the email structure: üëá
> 
> 1/ INTRO ‚Ä¢ 2-3 sentences ‚Ä¢ Briefly introduce yourself ‚Ä¢ Deliver lead magnet right away (if necc.) üëá
> 
> 2/ ASPIRATIONAL STATEMENT(S) ‚Ä¢ They‚Äôre here to achieve something ‚Ä¢ Assure they‚Äôve come to the right place ‚Ä¢ Shows you understand why they‚Äôre here üëá
> 
> 3/ SET EXPECTATIONS ‚Ä¢ Be transparent ‚Ä¢ Create anticipation ‚Ä¢ Tell exactly what to expect next üëá
> 
> 4/ DRIVE A REPLY ‚Ä¢ Make reply super easy ‚Ä¢ Good for deliverability ‚Ä¢ Gather useful information ‚Ä¢ Last thing before sign off üëá
> 
> All in all, a welcome email should be about 150 words. - engaging - short and sweet - focused on the other person üëá
> 
> Last thing before I go: People connect best with other people ‚Äî not brands or companies. We crave connection and relationship. Not just transactions. Treat your entire welcome sequence like real relationships with real people ‚Äî it‚Äôll be way more successful.
