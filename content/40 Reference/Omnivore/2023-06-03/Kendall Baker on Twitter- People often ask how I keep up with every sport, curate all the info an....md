## Highlights

> People often ask how I keep up with every sport, curate all the info and produce a daily newsletter with @JeffreyTracy. This is how. Left: RSS feed (@reederapp) with all my sources, including Twitter accounts, newsletters and subreddits. Right: Editorial calendar (@NotionHQ) [pic.twitter.com/DT9fjDpeSu](https://twitter.com/kendallbaker/status/1534950272849612800/photo/1)

> @JeffreyTracy @reederapp @NotionHQ Why this works so well: It allows me to "read the internet" at my own pace. I clear my feed like its an inbox — read most things, save some, archive most. Stories then flow into our calendar, where they can easily be shuffled around then moved into our CMS when they're ready.

> @JeffreyTracy @reederapp @NotionHQ I'm pretty much obsessed with information consumption and how to improve it, both for myself and others. There's SO MUCH info available to us. Building your own systems (like this one) or using products (like my newsletter) to make consumption more efficient gives you a leg up.
