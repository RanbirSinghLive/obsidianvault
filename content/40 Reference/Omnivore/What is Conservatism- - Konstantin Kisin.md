## Highlights

> A crisply distilled ideological schema that purports to be applicable to all people at all times and in all places disturbs the conservative’s instinct for the particular over the universal, the empirical over the rational, the concrete over the abstract, the pragmatic over the ideal, or – in that memorable phrase of Michael Oakeshott – ‘present laughter over utopian bliss.’ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-fd-9815-a-6-a-3-a-9-4-dab-8407-f-209-18bb141ac14#702ee945-01e7-495c-af41-dfb98db43852) 

> If one were to isolate a single organising idea behind conservatism one might well point to the notion of order. On this view, the real foe of conservatism is neither the liberal nor the socialist but rather the anarchist and the libertarian. Without order as the enabling condition of its flourishing, no society can be truly free, as Edmund Burke saw long ago when he observed ‘\[t\]he only liberty that is valuable is a liberty connected with order.’ 
> 
> Crucially, though, political and social order cannot be imposed arbitrarily from above nor can it be dictated by an atavistic devotion to a golden age that never was, but must rather be permitted to emerge organically as a response to the structures and patterns of the world as we find it, including the conditions that nature itself affords for our flourishing as mortal animals.

> No program of social engineering can dissolve the basic facts of human psychology or prevent the radically uneven distribution of human aptitudes in a given environment from crystallising itself into a hierarchy of honour. Moreover, as anyone who has lived in a socialist society can attest, every revolution brings a new aristocracy in its wake. The dissolution of one hierarchy simply ushers in a more arbitrary stratification, one more pernicious and difficult to dislodge for being cloaked in the illusion of equality.

> as Nassim Nicholas Taleb says somewhere—_ideas age in reverse_: the longer a precept or habit has survived, the more conducive it is likely to be to overcoming the challenges of those who inherit it. However staggering the advances the West has made in the last two centuries or so, the knowledge needed to solve coordination problems confronting us rarely if ever resides in a single mind. That is because it is dispersed and sedimented in laws, customs, norms, and rituals – a cumulative inheritance that should be applied in the present and passed on to the future in the absence of pressing and plausible reasons for abandoning them.
