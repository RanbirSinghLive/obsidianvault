## Highlights

> Since my very first day as mayor, the most pressing and complex priority has been addressing the humanitarian crisis concentrated near Mass Ave and Melnea Cass Blvd (“Mass &amp; Cass”)—dozens of people living on the street in the grips of substance use, mental illness, and homelessness.
> 
> In just over a year and a half, we’ve made solid progress on a situation that has been many years in the making. But in a world that craves quick fixes and deserves urgent action, it’s not enough to move in the right direction—our job is also to be clear about what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and how our efforts are working or falling short. So today as we file [an ordinance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uVB7TWrP7j77CL7n4T1LsYVxqZhJc24y/view?usp=sharing) that’s part of a planned phase change at Mass &amp; Cass, it’s important to share the bigger picture.

Very unique example of an official "governing in public."

> In early December 2021, our public health teams [surveyed every resident in the encampments](https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/12/15/bostons-mass-cass-by-the-numbers/) to understand each person’s history, medical needs, and housing situation. Nearly everyone was living with substance use and medical conditions [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-wutrain-substack-com-p-looking-back-to-move-ahead-at-mass-18a56862067#010275c5-bfc0-4518-8810-a8e614f43373) 

> The vast majority of people described how existing shelter options felt out of reach for them, because of sobriety requirements or strict time windows to claim a bed for the night, or because there were no options for couples who wanted to stay together in a shelter system with only single-gender spaces.
