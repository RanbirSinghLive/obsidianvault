## Highlights

> **Do I submit to the benefits of** _**Large Language Models**_**, to re-write my paragraphs, to give me ideas in my novels … to simply edit here and there?**
> 
> **I, after much reflection, answer a resounding no; that doing so will call into question my integrity as an artist and remove the obstacles that I believe are essential for my artistic development, central to my personhood.**
> 
> **And in fact, I also believe it is this resistance, the maintaining of faith in one’s ‘merely human’ abilities, to never -** _**ever**_ **\- give up, in the face of Generative AI, that could inspire some of the greatest art ever produced.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-22357-a-59-1-a-35-4-e-54-bc-80-ad-97-19033a67f89#1c7c1bd4-1406-4148-9888-f44a4513570c)
