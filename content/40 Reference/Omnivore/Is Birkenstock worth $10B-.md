## Highlights

> “the Lindy Effect”, which is the idea that you can estimate how long something will last into the future based on how long it has already existed.
> 
> The idea is from Nicholas Nassim Taleb’s book [“Anti-Fragile](https://link.workweek.com/click/32954756.33149/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTGluZHlfZWZmZWN0I2NpdGVfbm90ZS04/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873Bc58e0572)_[”](https://link.workweek.com/click/32954756.33149/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvTGluZHlfZWZmZWN0I2NpdGVfbm90ZS04/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873Cc58e0572)_:

> _“If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years. But, and that is the main difference, if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another fifty years. This, simply, as a rule, tells you why things that have been around for a long time are not ‘aging’ like persons, but ‘aging’ in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. This is an indicator of some robustness. The robustness of an item is proportional to its life!”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/is-birkenstock-worth-10-b-18b09affeeb#be55e34f-769d-4881-9557-4bef0c1be704)
