## Highlights

> The term ‘patriarchy’ has, however, been overly and incorrectly used for years. It is, I argue, a concept, not a theory. For something to be a theory, it should be testable, empirical, and capable of making predictions. It should also be falsifiable. I argue that patriarchy, as either previously or currently used, is none of those things.

> scholars have made the mistake of assuming that if something is controlled by men, it must also always favour men. Yet, _controlled by_ is not the same as _controlled for_. 
> 
> A salient and current example of this comes from the all-male central government of Ukraine, who have permitted all females to flee the Ukraine upon Russia’s February 2014 invasion, but all males up to the age of 60 are legally obligated to risk their life in the fight for their country’s survival.

> Overall, it has been found that female defendants receive more lenient sentences, even when extra-legal factors are considered. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-6-ad-082-fd-f-9-c-7-4-e-8-a-a-155-1--18bcc01571e#2bc3fede-b76b-4274-9c7c-d90ab51ddc35) 

> However, the concept of the gender pay gap is the suggestion that women make 70% of what men make, for the same job, is not true. It is, in fact, illegal to pay women less than men for the same job. What the gender pay gap does is to examine an entire industry, and all the roles within, to then average the pay. Take airlines, where there is a gender pay gap differential that needs further analysis: for the most part, pilots are men and cabin crew are women, but who can credibly argue that pilots be paid the same as cabin crew? This makes the gender pay gap an illusion of patriarchy. What counts is not the gender pay gap, but the question: are women paid the same for the same level of education, experience, and competency as men? If they are not, a lawsuit surely awaits.

> This has meant we have a very serious decrease in the number of children being born to middle class families, as women work to establish careers before family. This trend begs the question, was it peril or privilege to be able to stay at home and take care of the children. I wish my husband made enough money for me to stay at home with our two young kids – if only I had such privilege.
