## Highlights

> Online creators have popularized the saying, “play in decades”, which does encourage one to think in longer terms. But even this can be too narrow-minded: we may think in terms of our own lifetime, but the people who built cathedrals, for example, had their great-great-great-grandchildren in mind. The men who sketched the first blueprint and the laid the first brick knew they would not live to see the completion of the building. And when they died, their children picked up where they left off, knowing that they themselves would also not be the last. Yet, they built anyway.
