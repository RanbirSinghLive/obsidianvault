## Highlights

> Sex differences in many aspects of behavior and cognition are now well-established. These include women’s more communal (formation of intimate relationships) and men’s more agentic (goal achievement) [approach to life](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211046006?ref=quillette.com), as well as men’s [advantage in spatial abilities](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.117.2.250?ref=quillette.com) and women’s advantage in memory for personal experiences ([episodic memory](https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000197?ref=quillette.com)). Current debates focus on their origin and range from [evolved biases](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-820480-1.00032-2?ref=quillette.com) to adherence to [socially imposed gender roles](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.128.5.699?ref=quillette.com).
