## Highlights

[[Alex Hormozi's Perfect Business]]
> The perfect business for me is getting paid a tremendous amount of money for your words, just your advice. I really do think the old-school merchant banks and M&amp;A boutiques like Lazard and Allen &amp; Co. and some of these places are pretty close to the perfect business, where someone has decided that your wisdom is so worthy that they're just going to give you hundreds of millions of dollars for it.

> And for the best ones, there's also this idea where the organizations are either selection effects or treatment effects. And so a selection effect would be Harvard or a modeling agency, where most of the prestige comes from picking the people. Whereas the seals or something like that, to some extent, will have a treatment effect, you become a different person by going through this program.
> 
> And I think the best organizations do both. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#42f7c0a2-f2c2-48ca-b1de-3242d087bb2c) 

> the perfect investment would be one where you actually never have to talk to any of the people or know anything about the business. You can just understand the circumstances around it and the incentives of the various interested parties and feel out why this opportunity exists, why you can solve it, and then why you're getting paid for it without ever knowing anyone. I think a lot of these, especially in the private markets, are just coordination problems. You're basically coming in, into a log jam and just unjamming it and you can get paid for that unjamming. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#4ee5e45a-bfb9-4f7e-9eeb-f5af7d85bd8d) 

> And so I think I take comfort in, "Oh, this is a really messy situation and I totally understand why other people's incentive structures don't allow them to fix this problem and why I can uniquely." And so that's why I think it's easy to make low-risk investments, if you like, understand things that way. Do you have a very good explanation? Yes, I got paid for this because I did these three or four things. And there's these five different stakeholders, and they all wanted these different things, and I figured out how to solve it and it unlocked this log jam. I like things that are very explainable, when it comes to investing at least. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#dfe4973d-8343-4b74-a9e0-1198922088d2) 

> Pre- and post-fall is really, I guess, a perversion of a Christian idea, which is, has someone really been brought to their knees by life. You can see it immediately. And I find it's entirely uncorrelated to who they are or what they grew up with or what they do in life or whatever, it just seems to be for random. And you can just see it in someone's eyes whether they've really been humbled deeply by life or they haven't.
> 
> And the reason that I find it useful is it gives you a sense of the capacity that, that person has suffering or pain. I find it to be a very good indicator of if something bad happens this person, how are they going to react? Extreme example would be someone with multiple combat deployment, probably not going to get too disturbed by something going wrong. Whereas maybe someone who's never had anything go wrong in their life, it's really going to disrupt them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#1bd9bfc1-9960-4a05-a5c7-9daef7c86524) 

> **Can you talk about the next binary, which is, I don't know what you want to call it, like brute force versus cleverness or repetitions versus efficiency or something like that?**
> 
> **Jeremy:** \[00:55:59\] Yes. I mean this one, I think you see everywhere, which is there's people out there who see linear progressions and just get excited. If I apply more effort to this input, then I know I'm going to get more output than anyone else. So they'll look at like a competitive situation or something and get really excited about it because they know that as long as they can work harder than everyone else, they're going to have -- it's like a very sure thing that they're going to have a higher level of success.
> 
> Whereas the clever person or the wits person is all about waiting around and waiting for the noncompetitive things, seeing the nonobvious thing, and then striking. And they're very different. And I think you can see this all the time. And I think generally, most investors are more on the clever side of things and most operators are more on the kind of the rep side of things, but obviously, they cross over, and at the top, people are generally both.

> companies will have -- in the same way that they'd have a technical co-founder, they'll have an audience co-founder. And all that person will do is organically sell that product or service to their audience over the long term in an authentic way.
> 
> The company really has to be intertwined with the creator or the person with the audience. That's going to be how people buy things. I mean especially for commodity products, which most products are, including most investing is a commodity. It's selling money. And so in any situation where it's a commodity, you're going to go with a person that you have a slight affinity for. And the way in which we build real affinity with people is long-form content or repeated exposure through social. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#0686023e-b5d1-49eb-b27b-87a5cb84b406) 

> I just still think it's amazing. It was a five-year run, two albums a year, and that was it. Most artists today put out an album every two or three years. Just as a phenomenon, maybe The Beatles as musicians are not underrated, but as earthly phenomenon, it's very underrated, this idea that you could just in this five-year run basically go on a perfect streak, permanently change things and then that's that. These amazing little bursts, there's really something to be said about just doing something really well for a short period of time accomplishing something. And then that's that. You've changed it.
> 
> There's also lots to learn from The Beatles. They were all better together than they were individually. And there's just something about just what can happen when you get the right mixture of people doing the right thing. I also think it's really underrated that they basically changed genres every album. I think that also never happens.
> 
> I think there's really a lot to be studied there even though it's already been studied a ton. Just hanging it up on top, that's also hugely important. Way more people should do that. I think The Beatles will be significantly diminished if they were still touring. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/special-situations-in-private-markets-colossus-189aec42590#5335c315-fde9-40c1-b240-3909dfac7fb4) 

> Society is going to be better off if you do everything that interests to you. And even if it means you're a worse investor, but you're like a more interesting, unique person, not only will that be better for you, it's also necessary for society. And I take that to heart a lot because I think it's easy to just be like this pre-described thing and be good at it, and that will be good. But no, actually, we need people who are just one of one doing weird stuff. That's what moves us forward.
