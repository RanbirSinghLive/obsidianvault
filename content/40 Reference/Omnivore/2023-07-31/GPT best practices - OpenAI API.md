## Highlights

> Just as it is good practice in software engineering to decompose a complex system into a set of modular components, the same is true of tasks submitted to GPTs. Complex tasks tend to have higher error rates than simpler tasks. Furthermore, complex tasks can often be re-defined as a workflow of simpler tasks in which the outputs of earlier tasks are used to construct the inputs to later tasks.
