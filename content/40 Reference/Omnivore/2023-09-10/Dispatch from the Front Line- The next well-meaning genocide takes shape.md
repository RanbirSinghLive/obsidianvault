## Highlights

> The intellectually disabled Black father's intellectually disabled Black daughter is subject to exactly the same "historic factors and systemic racism" as her father. Yet as a direct result of the court's attempts to redress those very evils, she will, ironically, not receive the same justice as a comparable white victim. 
> 
> Why does this matter? Because most crimes of this nature (homicide, domestic assault, sexual assault, and, obviously, incest) happen within ethnic groups, not between them. A white woman is statistically more likely to be killed by a white man; a Black woman a Black man, and so on. There is no racial reasoning for this, it’s just the result of opportunity and math.
