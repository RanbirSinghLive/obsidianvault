## Highlights

> A good price point is one that is high enough to effectively ration the product (i.e. stop the pool being overcrowded) but low enough that people actually pay it. Put bluntly, if you sell everything, you are too cheap. A good lesson for airlines, who should aim to achieve 85% to 90%-ish seat factor, not 99% or 100%.
