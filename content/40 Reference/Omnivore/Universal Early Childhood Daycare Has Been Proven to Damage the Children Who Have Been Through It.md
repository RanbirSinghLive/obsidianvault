## Highlights

> Mothering, it turns out, is hard to scale up. In very early life, mothering is essentially 24/7 mind-body-state-tending. An aware mother notices a baby’s subtle cues of hunger, distress, or curious interest, and responds swiftly, whether to address a need, engage socially, or otherwise restore equilibrium. Especially under age one, when self-regulation skills are nil, a baby requires a great deal of "external co-regulation” just to manage the sensations of his body and the intensity of his feelings.

> Just imagine a mother who births quintuplets. This happened in my town. She was inundated with free diapers, free baby food, strollers, cribs, a minivan, and offers of recurrent daily help— because everybody knew there was nothing normal about one mom caring for five tiny babies. Yet this ratio is typical in early daycare. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-link-sbstck-com-redirect-def-7-ac-4-d-374-d-4793-bf-36-fd--18a242c61dd#0d0bc72a-1896-4d81-b52d-b211d8feaff9) 

> We must have the courage to admit that outsourcing early infancy, while it has benefitted women’s economic viability and corporate bottom lines, has not benefitted kids. We must imagine a feminist solution that puts small children into the lifeboat first.
