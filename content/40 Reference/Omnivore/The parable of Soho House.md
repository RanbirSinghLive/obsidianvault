## Highlights

> The most important social tensions are within the elite — not, as a decade of populism has pretended, between the elite and the people. 
> 
> The person likeliest to tear down a nation’s establishment is a half-member of it. He or she is close enough to have felt its condescension (which must be largely theoretical for a total outsider) and to know its weak points. Donald Trump, disdained as a bridge-and-tunnel vulgarian for all his material privilege, is the most famous example. But there are others. It wasn’t just England’s deindustrialised north and Midlands that voted for Brexit. So did the non-London south-east, an affluent place in the main, but also one teeming with the sort of white-collar commuters who wouldn’t have made the Soho House cut in the past.
