## Highlights

> The Shirky Principle, named after writer Clay Shirky, states, "institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution."
> 
> In simple terms, companies (or people) have a tendency to avoid fully eliminating the problem that they sell a solution for, lest they become obsolete.
> 
> Business and profit incentives can actually preserve the existence of problems.
> 
> Potential examples of the Shirky Principle in action:
> 
> * Pharmaceutical companies see more money in treating lifelong illness than in curing it.
> * Defense contractors make much more money from war than from peace. When there is peace, people wonder why we're spending so much money on national defense.
> * Technology companies want their products to slow down after a period of time so that consumers buy the new model.
> * Personal trainers make more money from clients remaining slightly unfit than from clients who become fit and no longer need their services. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-greatest-life-hack-decision-making-tools-more-the-curiosity--18978eb7abe#412a207f-8b2a-4cd1-a393-deeb9a8fb2bb)
