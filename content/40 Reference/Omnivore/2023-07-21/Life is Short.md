## Highlights

> You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/life-is-short-1897a0df406#3650ff8f-ff11-44d5-9070-57ce827c7d08)
