## Highlights

> It’s obvious that the AIs can write better than 90% of humanity all the time, and the other 10% of humanity 90% of the time. It’s not a mere tool. It’s an obviously better way to do what too many humans do.
> 
> As a first-order effect, a lot of routine business communication is already being highly accelerated by AI. Business communication is not particularly creative or even stylized. It has been ripe for automation since the word _boilerplate_ was coined in the age of exploding boilers.

> Here is one of many cartoons (this one is from [marketoonist](https://marketoonist.com/)) making the same _almost_ right, but actually fatally wrong, point about second-order effects.

> There is no _fundamental_ reason human society has to be built around natural language as a kind of machine code. Plenty of other species manage fine with simpler languages or no language at all. And it is not clear to me that intelligence has much to do with the linguistic fabric of contemporary society.

> Imagine a world a few centuries in the future, where humans look back on the era of reaction gifs as the beginning of the world after language. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-ribbonfarm-com-2023-05-04-life-after-language-189783fb71a#68b3f88c-ed2f-4933-8f78-28e45f94494b) 

> Now that a future beyond language is imaginable, it suddenly seems to me that humanity has been stuck in a linguistically constrained phase of its evolution for far too long. I’m not quite sure how it will happen, or if I’ll live to participate in it, but I suspect we’re entering a world beyond language where we’ll begin to realize just how deeply blinding language has been for the human consciousness and psyche.
