## Highlights

> 1. **Make candlelight ordinary**
> 
> > Whenever I’ve travelled to Scandinavia, I’ve noticed that candles are used in a very distinct way. They are not treated as special or romantic, but as an everyday accessory, part of the ordinary workings of the home. In particular, candles are lit early, burning through grey mornings and dull afternoons. They do not seem to be there to illuminate anything, but instead to offer warmth and contrast to the blue winter light. It’s changed the way I use candles in my house, and I commend this to you all.

> 1. **Light the outside**
> 
> > For the past couple of years, I’ve put up my Christmas lights early, making my front garden twinkle from November. I don’t take them down until Candlemas in February. This is because: well, why not? I’ve given up worrying whether it’s tacky. It makes the dark evenings feel friendlier and delights passing children. That’s all I need to know.
