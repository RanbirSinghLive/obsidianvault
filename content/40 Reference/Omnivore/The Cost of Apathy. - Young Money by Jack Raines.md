## Highlights

> > _If pandemic-induced remote work showed me anything, it showed me how little "work" was necessary to do my job. I legitimately "worked" 5-10 hours per week at times, but I was always pretending to "work", by either moving my mouse to look active or tinkering with files, models, and decks that didn't really need tinkering to pass the time._
> > 
> > _It was pretty obvious that if I didn't show up for a day, week, or month, the show would go on. I was playing with an unplugged remote._

> The reality of corporate America is that if you follow the rules, do what you’re supposed to do, and maintain pleasant relationships with your coworkers, inertia takes over, and you can make a living wage while coasting through your career by answering a few emails, updating a few spreadsheets, and making the occasional presentation.
>

> While our ancestors risked starving or freezing to death, the risks we face today are psychological, not physiological. **In a world where survival is all-but-guaranteed, your greatest risk is that you spend your life not really doing a whole lot of anything.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-cost-of-apathy-young-money-by-jack-raines-19151f5584c#eef7f92b-0ee7-4460-9697-df8e4951764c) 

> “Good enough” might be the optimal strategy for your 401k, where you want to set your money in the S&P 500 and forget about it, but your life isn’t an index fund, and the purpose of life isn’t to optimize for some minimum viable income that pays you enough to cover your mortgage as you sleepwalk to your grave.

> **The point of life is to live, and living isn’t a spectator sport.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-cost-of-apathy-young-money-by-jack-raines-19151f5584c#8074f817-1c0d-4f4c-8dc4-d054a00364ca)
