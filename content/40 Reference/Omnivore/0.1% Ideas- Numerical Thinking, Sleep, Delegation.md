## Highlights

> **Paired tasking for delegation:**​  
> ​  
> Delegating things that are easy to do is easy. Delegating things that are hard to do is much harder – by definition.  
> ​  
> The hard tasks as a result never get delegated because the risk is too high of the person making a mistake.  
> ​  
> The hack I’m finding useful for the latter is paired tasking. Do the task alongside the other person, and compare results afterwards. After 3-4 iterations, you can begin to delegate these harder tasks.  
> ​  
> You was going to do the task anyway. So why not do paired tasking? Your future self will thank you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/0-1-ideas-numerical-thinking-sleep-delegation-18eb76fe4ab#697381ec-9f90-44d5-9e9e-517a129f506a)
