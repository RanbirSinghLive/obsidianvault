## Highlights

> Our very existences are highly contingent. Many years ago, a young man was driving to visit his uncle when his car broke down in upstate New York and he had to spend the next two days there waiting for it to be repaired. While there, he met a young woman who was vacationing with some friends. They fell in love, married, and had a child—me. I owe my existence to something going wrong with an Oldsmobile at a very specific place and time. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/clumsy-gods-18de5e23cc7#054b3e97-6160-4211-b9cf-0d5e86036573)
