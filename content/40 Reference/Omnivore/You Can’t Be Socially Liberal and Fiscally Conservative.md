## Highlights

> Ordinary people tend to be relatively more socially conservative and economically liberal. This position makes sense. 
> 
> The position is roughly that people should adhere to norms but if they fail there should be a safety net available.
> 
> Highly educated and affluent people are more economically conservative and socially liberal. This doesn’t make sense. 
> 
> The position is roughly that people shouldn’t have to adhere to norms and if/when they inevitably hurt themselves or others, then there should be no safety net available.
> 
> It’s a luxury belief.
> 
> A socially permissive society will inevitably give rise to social ills that must be paid for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-c-9486596-e-4-a-4-4367-bc-17-ebf-549-18bb13e77a8#86a0a277-9fe7-447b-8a7f-dad5c01951f9) 

> The luxury belief class thinks that the unhappiness associated with certain behaviors and choices is primarily stems from the negative social judgments they elicit, rather than the behaviors and choices themselves.
> 
> But in fact, negative social judgments serve as guardrails to deter detrimental decisions that lead to unhappiness.
> 
> To avoid misery we have to admit that certain actions and choices are actually in and of themselves undesirable—fatherlessness, obesity, substance abuse, crime, and so on—and not simply in need of normalization.
