## Highlights

> A core loop is a series of repeated patterns related to the core behavior a user goes through while using the product. A simple core loop has three repeating steps 1) action, 2) reward, and 3) expansion.
> 
> The user performs an action and is rewarded for it, and that reward helps them “expand” their growth or progression within the product. Between reward and expansion is “anticipation”, which is when the brain releases dopamine to the user. This is a huge part of what causes motivation, and “addiction” for lack of a better word.

> 
> Over repeated loops of anticipation and expansion, we begin to see “investment” into the product — which creates a sense of dedication and reduces the chances of the user leaving the platform.

> A lot of products fail here due to the presence of a single core loop that takes too long or is too hard to complete.
> 
> For optimal engagement, a product needs to contain a dual loop consisting of smaller “inner” session loops resulting in a minor reward, and larger “outer” session loops resulting in a major reward.

> 
> These shorter inner core loops exit to lower the barrier to investment, provide a lot of initial progress towards expansion, and can be chained together &amp; done more often compared to outer loops.
> 
> The combination of having multiple inner loops, and a few outer loops, allow users to spend as little or as much time as desired using the product while still feeling productive, and that their time was well spent.
