## Highlights

> **A good story is like leverage for ideas**. Stories leverage ideas the same way debt leverages assets. A idea on its own might be boring, but if you tell a good story about someone interacting with that idea, you can get people to nod their heads and pay attention. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-the-written-word-18ae65f488e#c0be00a0-57ff-4cbf-8d32-16f7a51179b0) 

> **People don’t remember books, blogs, or articles**. They remember sentences. That should be your goal: a collection of memorable sentences. One good line is infinitely more powerful than a few clumsy paragraphs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-the-written-word-18ae65f488e#2dea5e82-f241-49d1-ade3-8e2001f8d2b7) 

> **But efficient doesn’t necessarily mean brief**. There are 900-page books where every word adds value. Efficient just means every line is a delight to read. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-the-written-word-18ae65f488e#bfeadc30-a18f-4332-b6e7-5670ddf829d5) 

> **The best books I’ve read have short chapters**. Even if they are long books, they break things into quick sections that keep you moving. It keeps the author succinct and makes the reader feel like they’re progressing.
