## Highlights

> The former CEO of Slack [recently explained](https://twitter.com/volodarik/status/1665854827224498177?s=20) a fascinating reason bloat seeps into successful companies. Managers vying for attention often rank themselves off a simple metric: How many employees report to them. The incentive, then, is to hire tons of people ‚Äì even if they have little work to do ‚Äì so a manager can say, ‚Äú400 people report to me,‚Äù which signals their alleged value and importance. And you can only pull that off at a company with so much money and so much success that obnoxious budgets are approved.

> Shane Parrish [once described](https://fs.blog/entropy/) the difference between passive and active stability. A rock is passively stable ‚Äì it‚Äôll keep its form without any intervention. Marriage is not. It can be stable over time, but it requires constant work, compromise, and maintenance to keep it intact.

> Most things in your life are, at best, actively stable. Left alone they‚Äôll follow the natural path of cyclicality. But if there‚Äôs constant intervention and management ‚Äì managing your expectations, managing your reputation, managing how you advertise yourself and who you surround yourself with ‚Äì you have at least a shot at keeping something good going for the longest period of time.
