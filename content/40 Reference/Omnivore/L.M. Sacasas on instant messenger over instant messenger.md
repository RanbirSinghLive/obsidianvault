## Highlights

> And I wanted to ask you first about your relationship with this technology.
> 
> Personally it’s suffused with affection and nostalgia for me — my teenage romantic flirtations (I think "relationships" might be stretching it) were conducted very largely on IM, so it's always going to have a certain halo. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-r-8-u-0-v-6-v-039-ioh-2-xlw-6-ps-18ae4698c3b#ee8d3334-017b-4a97-b7ac-e0fbd243cf51) 

> Ordinarily, there's a rhythm to the give and take of a conversation, which depends on reading silences. But that doesn't quite work the same way in this context. It's a bit harder to read silence if our bodies are not also present. And that, I think, is a good way to analyze a medium of communication, by comparing it to communication in a fully embodied context.

> I'm even self conscious now about the difference between only hitting "send" after a paragraph, and between hitting "send" after each individual line of text
> 
> meanwhile, email often frustrates me because there is TOO much time to polish, it feels like I can't just say what's on my mind and work things out, whatever I send feels "final" in some sense I really dislike
> 
> and sometimes there's very long "silences" between my email and a reply, where I'm torn between feeling "this person secretly hates me" and "they just haven't got around to answering yet" [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-r-8-u-0-v-6-v-039-ioh-2-xlw-6-ps-18ae4698c3b#daa548ff-bca9-474d-b67f-790950fffb80)
