## Highlights

> In some ways, we only remember moments in our lives that had some form of texture, often in the form of surprise or difficulty. A string of beach vacations all blend together, but challenging hikes or missed flights stand out in our memories.

> We are entering an era where every company and product we interact with will have an AI agent. Perhaps even every object, from cars to kitchen appliances, will be intelligent. These agents will initially work with us, but will eventually negotiate and work directly with our own personal AI agents on our behalf. We’ll eventually be abstracted from daily transactions.
