## Highlights

> ​**I'm going to be doing my Sakoku trip.** ​  
> ​  
> What is this?   
> ​  
> When I ask people where they want to travel to: Most say Japan.   
> ​  
> Why? IMO - Japan practiced an isolationist policy called Sakoku for 265 years. They cut off the outside world -- resulting in their unique culture   
> ​  
> Once per quarter, I practice **Sakoku** for a weekend or a week.   
> ​  
> I'll just be taking in minimal inputs outside the best ideas I've found and time to think + have fun.   
> ​  
> I always come out of it with some fantastic ideas and a new plan. Due to the fewer societal inputs, the plan always feels less mimetic and more first principles based.
