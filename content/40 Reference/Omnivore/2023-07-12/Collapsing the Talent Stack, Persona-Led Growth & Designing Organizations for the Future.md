## Highlights

> **Ok, I want to use Generative AI, now what?** This is a common question I get, as recently as last week during a fireside chat with the Chief Digital &amp; Marketing Officer at L’Oreal. Great brands are eager to engage with this exciting technology but often debate how and where to get started. I proposed a framework that is (conveniently) four P’s: Play, Pilot, Protect, and Provoke. PLAY - since novelty often precedes utility, you need to allow (with the right guardrails) your teams to play with this new technology (given them access to ChatGPT or products like Firefly but with rules). PILOT - pick one particular low-risk project and task your team with doing it “the new way.” This could mean leveraging GenAI for social media marketing images instead of the old way…whatever this means for you, identify a pilot project. PROTECT - your team needs to be allowed to fail when trying something new, so define an incubation zone of sorts for your team to do their play and run this first pilot. PROVOKE - as difficult questions emerge, foster an environment where they can be asked and debated. This is transformative technology with many ethical and meaningful implications that must be discussed.
