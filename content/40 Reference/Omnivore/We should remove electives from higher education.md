## Highlights

> Unlike the other universities vying for a three-year degree, through BYU-Pathway, both BYU-Idaho and Ensign College offer degrees that are online and asynchronous, making their degrees available worldwide. Griffith thinks that’s why they were the first to be approved by the accrediting authority. As of 2023, the schools are attended by 67,000 students living in 180 countries. Most students—20,000 of them—live in Africa.
> 
> “When you're telling a student from Africa, who is struggling to find two meals a day, where unemployment rates are through the roof, and they’re doing everything they can just to subsist in life, to ‘take any class you want, just for the fun of it.’ That's not a good answer. It was those African students who really got our attention and had us asking: ‘why are we making these students take 30 elective credits?’”
> 
> The schools do a lot to remove boundaries to education. Not only are classes asynchronous so students can study on their own time, but tuition is priced according to a country's economic status: BYU-Idaho students pay $194 per credit hour on campus, domestic students pay $81 online, and international students pay $14 on average. All textbooks are ebooks, and Griffith says they are working to eliminate even that expense now that so much information is free and readily available online.
> 
> Students also earn certificates, associate degrees, and ultimately a bachelor’s degree along the way so that, even if they leave school after a year, they are already credentialed in something that might improve their career and their income potential. Griffith calls them “stackable degrees.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/we-should-remove-electives-from-higher-education-18d0e835596#42695ab4-ca0c-45a9-9246-bb8234012c5e)
