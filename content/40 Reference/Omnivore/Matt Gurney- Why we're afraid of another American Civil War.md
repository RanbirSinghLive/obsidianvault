## Highlights

> It's hard to find a precise, universally recognized definition of speculative fiction, but it refers to any fiction set in a reality that has a consistent set of rules, but that are different from our own. It might be easier to explain via example: science fiction is something like _Alien_ or my own beloved _Star Trek_, but speculative fiction would be something more like either the written or televised depiction of Margaret Atwood's _The Handmaid's Tale_. There are no Klingons or phasers in Atwood's nightmare world, but it's also very clearly different from our own.
