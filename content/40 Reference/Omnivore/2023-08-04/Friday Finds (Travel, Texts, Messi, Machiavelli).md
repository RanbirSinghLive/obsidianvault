## Highlights

> ​[**The Boy at the Music Festival**](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/p9uroqor79t9h3gzo0ziqhmrmm933/25h2hoh200vn3wa8/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9kYXZpZF9wZXJlbGwvc3RhdHVzLzE2ODc0MTQ3ODA0OTQwMDgzMjA%5Fcz0yMA==)**:** People always laugh at the first person to do something. Then somebody else joins. Then, another one. Then a whole crowd joins in, and the first person goes from looking like a goon to looking like a genius.

> ​[**The Park Bench Scene in Goodwill Hunting**](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/p9uroqor79t9h3gzo0ziqhmrmm933/08hwh9hdwwoqgohp/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9kYXZpZF9wZXJlbGwvc3RhdHVzLzE2ODUzMzQ5NDA0MjkyNTQ2NTY%5Fcz0yMA==)**:** You can see something 10,000 times on your phone, but you won't understand it until you see it in person for the first time. That’s the lesson from the park bench scene in _Good Will Hunting_. Matt Damon is the arrogant, book-smart intellectual who has seen little but has read everything. Robin Williams is the wise professor who rolls his eyes at Damon’s hubris. The stuff of life can only be fully absorbed through direct experience, he says. Take travel, for example. Something about the Golden Gate Bridge can only be understood when you feel the wind from the Pacific Ocean and shiver under a blanket of fog. Something about the life of Moses can only be understood when you stand atop Mount Nebo (where he died) and look down at the Promised Land of Israel. Something about Italian food can only be understood when you slurp “siero” in a Parmesan cheese factory and meet the fourth-generation shop owner. Pixels on a screen aren’t enough. Get out and Do the Thing because certain kinds of knowledge can only be gained through tactile, first-hand experience.
