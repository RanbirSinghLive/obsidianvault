## Highlights

> Faith in God facilitates the belief that things can improve, even when people are at a low point in life [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-eedbb-87-a-b-471-4-b-21-b-718-9-f-1--18adc28e883#1e7ced89-af52-428d-b63e-45fabbe68fb8) 

> Faith in God facilitates the belief that things can improve, even when people are at a low point in life. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-eedbb-87-a-b-471-4-b-21-b-718-9-f-1--18adc28e883#d8acf624-0893-4e01-893b-a77827e7113e) 

> My favourite explanation for how spirituality and religion may protect against suicide originates from the work of [Viktor Frankl](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-viktor-frankls-logotherapy-can-offer-in-the-anthropocene) – the Austrian psychiatrist who survived the Nazi concentration camps, and observed that having a sense of meaning and purpose is a key predictor of human wellbeing. When my patients perceive their anxiety, depression or other problems as being potentially constructive in their lives – when they view their struggles as an opportunity to grow in terms of self-awareness, connection with others, or resilience – they rarely (if ever) display significant suicidality. While this philosophical perspective is technically agnostic, in practice it often dovetails with and even emanates from spiritual and religious teachings.
