## Highlights

> **Joe Coulombe built the Trader Joe’s brand** to appeal to educated shoppers who wanted international cuisines [after reading two magazine articles](https://link.workweek.com/click/32807847.32505/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVhZHRydW5nLmNvbS9wL3RyYWRlci1qb2VzLXRoZS1hbnRpLWdyb2Nlcg/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873B76cd00a3). The first one was from _Scientific American_, which discussed the increasing percentage of the US population with a college degree. The second was an article from the _Wall Street Journal_ that talked about the launch of Boeing 747s, which would reduce the cost of international travel.

> **Chip Wilson was motivated to build Lululemon** partly due to his reading about the [demographic trend of women staying in their jobs for longer periods of time and delaying childbirth](https://link.workweek.com/click/32807847.32505/aHR0cHM6Ly9jaGlwd2lsc29uLmNvbS9jaGFwdGVyL3RoZS13b3JsZC1pbi0xOTk4Lw/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873B773446d0). As these women were going to the gym, running errands, and spending hours at the office, he believed there was an emerging need for female technical athletic gear that could be worn throughout the day.

> reminds me of the "Talent Stack" framework popularized by cartoonist Scott Adams.
> 
> He created _Dilbert_, which became one of the most successful comic strips ever.
> 
> Did he do it by being the best — or a 99th percentile — artist? No. He was probably in the 70th percentile when it came to drawing. But he was also in the 70th percentile for humor and 70th percentile for business writing (based on his experience in the corporate world). In his specific Venn diagram of skills — drawing, humor, and business writing (aka “Talent Stack”) — Adams was in the 99th percentile.
> 
> Reading and comprehension are skills. In an increasingly digitally distracted world, fewer and fewer people are honing these skills. This presents a huge opportunity for those who want to build a niche 99th percentile talent stack by combining reading — and the insights gained from the experience — with a few other skills.

> 
> Nowadays, the bar is actually very low to be considered a top-percentile reader. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-reading-unlock-18ac196f988#19f45b6c-d4b4-47f8-9e13-727026b9268e)
