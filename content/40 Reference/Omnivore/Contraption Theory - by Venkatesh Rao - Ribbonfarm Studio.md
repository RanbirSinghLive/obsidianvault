## Highlights

> Helicopter rotors are possibly the pinnacle of mechanical engineering. The thing fundamentally _wants_ to spin out of control every which way, and you have to do clever but not deep contraptioneering to arrange all those tendencies so they cancel out. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-ribbonfarmstudio-p-contraption-theor-191ca0e57bc#8812d47b-d12c-4322-8117-91c683056f52) 

> There is something rather steampunk about helicopters. They seem to belong in some parallel universe where technology never evolved past early electric power, and therefore mechanical engineering had to keep getting more complex — and contraptiony — to add more technological capabilities to society. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-ribbonfarmstudio-p-contraption-theor-191ca0e57bc#60e33822-2fdc-4dbe-be3b-c29f6a1b0600) 

> In our own universe, the history of technology has a clear trend of complexity moving to the newest layer. Mechanical engineering got more complex — up to a point. Then it hit an uncompetitive limit, and electricity took over. Then electronics. Then computers. If you trace the evolution of a typical artifact, you can see the progression and migration of complexity in many machines, as it gets “eaten” by successive waves of technology.
