## Highlights

> This habit has also introduced me to some fascinating Greek words. My favorite is [_Archegos_](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/qdurzozrxgt7h7q8z24tlhn4k2wkk/3ohphkh7dx8o0lcp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmlibGV0b29scy5vcmcvaW5kZXguY2ZtL2Z1c2VhY3Rpb24vdG9waWNhbC5zaG93L1JURC9jZ2cvSUQvMjgwMi9BcmNoZWdvcy5odG0=), which means three things: (1) author, (2) ruler, and (3) founder. How could the same word mean all three things? An _Archegos_ is the head or beginning of something. To live like one is to lead change and bring new ideas into the world. The American founding fathers come to mind. With a pen in hand, they set the frame for what the United States would become.
