He cites that social push-back as the reason that the lion's share of successful startup founders have Asperger’s. A severe case can obviously be debilitating. People with Asperger’s are unemployed at rates that far exceed the general population. But a lighter case may increase the chances of making a breakthrough innovation, and it's worth asking why that is. To that end, I find it amusing when people are surprised that wild innovators think wild thoughts. The idea that unusual things would be accomplished by unusual people seems entirely logical to me. Or, as Kanye once said: “You know, if you guys want these crazy ideas and these crazy stages, this crazy music and this crazy way of thinking, there's a chance it might come from a crazy person." What does Thiel's observation reveal about society? What does it say about who runs the world?
