## Highlights

> Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called You. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#a8815203-3dae-410a-b81b-7af754798224) 

> To start thinking like your own favorite brand manager, ask yourself the same question the brand managers at Nike, Coke, Pepsi, or the Body Shop ask themselves: What is it that my product or service does that makes it different? Give yourself the traditional 15-words-or-less contest challenge. Take the time to write down your answer. And then take the time to read it. Several times. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#66d50000-43f2-4772-ac38-12100f69b758) 

> Your next step is to cast aside all the usual descriptors that employees and workers depend on to locate themselves in the company structure. Forget your job title. Ask yourself: What do I do that adds remarkable, measurable, distinguished, distinctive value? Forget your job description. Ask yourself: What do I do that I am most proud of? Most of all, forget about the standard rungs of progression you’ve climbed in your career up to now. Burn that damnable “ladder” and ask yourself: What have I accomplished that I can unabashedly brag about? If you’re going to be a brand, you’ve got to become relentlessly focused on what you do that adds value, that you’re proud of, and most important, that you can shamelessly take credit for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#b531b61a-18fd-45fa-afdc-daaf200be8a6) 

> sit down and ask yourself one more question to define your brand: What do I want to be famous for? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#b2b37ad6-e920-4044-b5f5-d420f6727880) 

> When you’re promoting brand You, everything you do — and everything you choose not to do — communicates the value and character of the brand. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#2f7be624-c248-4c68-938a-b9cf572c070d) 

> The key to any personal branding campaign is “word-of-mouth marketing.” Your network of friends, colleagues, clients, and customers is the most important marketing vehicle you’ve got; what they say about you and your contributions is what the market will ultimately gauge as the value of your brand. So the big trick to building your brand is to find ways to nurture your network of colleagues — consciously. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#83a890a4-03ed-4c60-81f5-17db7a61baf1) 

> Getting and using power — intelligently, responsibly, and yes, powerfully — are essential skills for growing your brand. One of the things that attracts us to certain brands is the power they project. As a consumer, you want to associate with brands whose powerful presence creates a halo effect that rubs off on you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#dcf39a52-06d2-4d0f-ad3a-9a1f8910081f) 

> Beg for the chance to write the report — because the hand that holds the pen (or taps the keyboard) gets to write or at least shape the organization’s history. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#1128efea-1310-4056-bc25-8a894d71b0e3) 

> One key to growing your power is to recognize the simple fact that we now live in a project world. Almost all work today is organized into bite-sized packets called projects. A project-based world is ideal for growing your brand: projects exist around deliverables, they create measurables, and they leave you with braggables. If you’re not spending at least 70% of your time working on projects, creating projects, or organizing your (apparently mundane) tasks into projects, you are sadly living in the past. Today you have to think, breathe, act, and work in projects. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#f29d5bd8-7f29-48b6-a533-b4b778b6494f) 

> You don’t have an old-fashioned résumé anymore! You’ve got a marketing brochure for brand You. Instead of a static list of titles held and positions occupied, your marketing brochure brings to life the skills you’ve mastered, the projects you’ve delivered, the braggables you can take credit for. And like any good marketing brochure, yours needs constant updating to reflect the growth — breadth and depth — of brand You. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#ad913613-a5fd-4568-a351-14871921a6ca) 

> being CEO of Me Inc. requires you to act selfishly — to grow yourself, to promote yourself, to get the market to reward yourself. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#28cfaea8-0e1b-46ad-8a62-b90e1725b5b0) 

> A career is a portfolio of projects that teach you new skills, gain you new expertise, develop new capabilities, grow your colleague set, and constantly reinvent you as a brand. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-brand-called-you-tom-peters-1883af9baa2#27044305-e0f7-4bef-a1fb-bdb0c52d0918)
