## Highlights

> A new [survey](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/young-put-off-having-children-by-global-fears-z5c2w5f3l) reveals that only 55% of Gen Z and millennials plan to have children. One in four of those surveyed, aged between 18 and 34, has ruled out parenthood entirely, with the most common reason cited being “wanting time for themselves”.
> 
> Why this increasing need for more “me time”? A likely reason is that young people are now navigating an era of [“extended adolescence”](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/extended-adolescence-when-25-is-the-new-181/).

> Contemporary culture keeps us all straddling a strange, intermediate state in which we face the pressures of adult life but are encouraged to cling to and prolong our “selfish years” as long as possible.
