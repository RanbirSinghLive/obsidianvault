## Highlights

> People in individualistic cultures overestimate their ability to lead, whereas those in collectivistic cultures overestimate ability to listen. People appear to be selectively overconfident in abilities that will garner higher status in their particular social environment.

> People reported higher levels of pain after re-living a past socially painful event (e.g., romantic breakup, betrayal by a friend) than after re-living a past physically painful event (e.g., severe injury, broken bone). Vividly imagining social (vs. physical) pain led to greater self-reported re-experienced pain.
