## Highlights

> Fitzgerald once wrote, "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lessons-from-the-age-of-excess-18877b5d2cb#83e018cf-2450-4b2d-be83-b17f43e26d30) 

> He called it "double vision”. Fitzgerald wanted readers to emotionally invest in his stories while still maintaining the ability to objectively criticize it. 
> 
>  It was an ideal he was gunning for in his writing, but he had difficulty emotionally distancing himself from the protagonist’s struggle. Why? Because those protagonists were modeled after himself.
