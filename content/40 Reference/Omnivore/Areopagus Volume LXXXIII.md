## Highlights

> That the thing we call "the state" or "the government" does not exist in the soil or the stars; you cannot find it with a microscope. This does not mean it "isn't real", as some might be tempted to say. Rather, its reality rests on our ability to understand the ideas underlying government, and then — this being the crucial step — agree about them. Thus they are peculiarly fragile, these things we call governments, because ultimately they rely on people accepting their existence. "Obvious!" some may cry. Perhaps, but I dare say it is a thing easily forgotten. And the Restoration, symbolised by Charles' return to England all those years ago today, is a perfect example of this strange but vital truth in action.
