## Highlights

> Warren Buffett once said that he often hears rich people talk about how dangerous a welfare society is, creating a generation of moochers reliant on food stamps and unemployment benefits. But “these same people are leaving their kids a lifetime supply of food stamps and beyond” he said. “Instead of having a welfare officer, they have a trust fund officer. And instead of having food stamps, they have stocks and bonds that pay dividends.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-few-laws-of-getting-rich-collab-fund-18b51b95a8c#944c38f0-de7b-4ab1-8a63-e3e2ee56421b) 

> It’s like the saying, “The higher the monkey climbs on the pole, the more you can see its ass.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-few-laws-of-getting-rich-collab-fund-18b51b95a8c#678bd0b4-f5cc-43a3-b1c8-fa3bc8c2865e)
