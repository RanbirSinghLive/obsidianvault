## Highlights

> That year was the 80th anniversary of the end of the _First_ World War. For the last time, the Canadian government sent veterans of _la Grande Guerre_ back to France for commemorations at Arras, Vimy Ridge, and Mons. I met them there. The youngest was 98\. Most were 100 or older. They were all frail shells, antiques from a world long vanished. One described how, as a junior officer on the staff of General Sir Arthur Currie, he had stood in the town square of Mons at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Girls rushed up to give him a kiss. Men pressed drinks into his hand. 
> 
> It was like speaking with a ghost.
> 
> I also recall how, when I told colleagues where I was going and why, they were astonished to hear there were any Great War veterans still alive. These men had long ceased to be alive in the memory of the wider community. They were, in a real sense, ghosts.

> We could bemoan this, I suppose, and struggle against it, but some degree of forgetting is as necessary and inevitable for the collective as it is for the individual. Like the rower in Fitzgerald’s metaphorical boat, we can pull hard as we like against the current but still we will be “borne back ceaselessly into the past.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-line-between-memory-and-history-by-dan-gardner-18fa16b234e#a129451c-86d1-4eba-995e-9ee3be5a07c9)
