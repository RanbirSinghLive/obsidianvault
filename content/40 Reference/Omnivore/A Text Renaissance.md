## Highlights

> Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms — escaped reality construction might be the general category — is what Roam _wants_ to be about. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-text-renaissance-189feea9654#26839020-67d9-4680-8235-c7bc1fc5aff6) 

> Email today is now less a communications medium than a communications compile target. It’s a clearinghouse technology. It’s where conversations-of-record go, where identity verification happens, where service alerts accumulate, and perhaps most importantly for publishers, where push-delivered longform content goes by default. It is distributed and federated, near universal, and is not monopolized by a single provider. Now that a constellation of other product categories have hived off around it in the last two decades, it’s finally finding its own true nature.
