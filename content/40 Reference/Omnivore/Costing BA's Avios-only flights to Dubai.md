## Highlights

> I have a little technique I use that takes published fares and calculates a “best-guess” estimate of how much revenue particular flights and routes can generate for airlines. I call it the “shelf” principle.
> 
> Imagine you are in a shop looking at the things for sale. Items on the bottom shelf are often the cheapest. You need to look for them and reach down to pick ‘em up. But because they are cheap and the Law of Demand applies, many people will. So items on the bottom shelf sell at low prices but in high volume.
> 
> Now consider the top shelf. That is where the ~~specialist magazines~~ priciest items tend to be. Everyone can see them, but not everyone wants them. So the shop puts them above your hands and you need to reach up if you want one. The top shelf has low volume but high prices.
> 
> Finally, imagine of the middle shelf. It is eye level and in easy reach – desirable real estate. It has all your favourite brands on, but maybe you do not always buy your favourite. The middle shelf has mid-range volume and mid-range prices.
> 
> So…
> 
> > Bottom shelf – high volume, low prices
> > 
> > Top shelf – low volume, high prices

> > Middle shelf – mid-range volume, mid-range prices
> 
> All three shelves probably generate the same revenue. Or margin, since this is retail. The key idea is that each shelf contributes equally. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/costing-ba-s-avios-only-flights-to-dubai-18c6c6343c0#4d6db9c1-179e-41d0-9922-fc0eab7e622d)
