## Highlights

> In December 1970, West Germany and Poland signed the [Treaty of Warsaw](https://substack.com/redirect/42f9e001-6ea3-487e-9c04-21a40c9108ed?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE), which meant that Germany accepted that Poland would keep a region that had been Germanic for centuries and had belonged to Germany before the war. Willy Brandt, then-chancellor of West Germany, [told](https://substack.com/redirect/c93f452c-1180-4038-abb0-bf1bdbdf1d91?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) his [people](https://substack.com/redirect/3ea2bc12-2fed-4f73-98af-99a5663d55c3?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) that it was time to move on: 
> 
> > _The point now is to prove that we have come of age and that we have the courage to acknowledge reality. \[….\] \[The Treaty with Poland\] does not surrender anything that was not gambled away long ago \[….\] \[This is\] a policy not of surrender but of common sense_.
> 
> A cornerstone of two-state peace projects is to get Palestinians and Israelis to do this now. They miss a crucial fact: This was _in 1970._ 25 years after the end of WWII! Why so long? It took that long to rewire the German psyche. Politicians seldom lead public opinion.¹⁶ They _follow it._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/gmail-how-to-solve-the-israel-palestine-problem-18bafed33e2#b2723da0-01c0-4bfa-a1cd-13bc7f1ca768) 

> The US occupied Japan for seven years after 1945 and transformed it from a radical enemy to one of its staunchest allies. The cornerstone of this turnaround was the [Japanese constitution](https://substack.com/redirect/af7a2781-fbb8-4af1-b38d-e7761fc9e434?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE), written by the US, based on Western constitutions, and approved by Japanese lawmakers. It [prevented Japan from having a military](https://substack.com/redirect/62cfef5f-cc96-46a5-a162-1d9a000f9e31?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) (thus making Japan dependent on the US), established democracy and freedom of speech, legalized labor unions and democratic parties, gave women the right to vote, and kept Hirohito as emperor—but only as a figurehead—to reduce grudges and use his influence in the transition. They made him declare he was not a god. The US also decentralized the police, and more importantly, heavily [restructured education](https://substack.com/redirect/964df80d-c1dd-427d-8d00-680c677ad584?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE): It decentralized it, changed textbooks, extracted the military, allowed parent-led school boards, and mixed sexes in classrooms.
> 
> Despite establishing freedom of speech, the US heavily censored the Japanese media for years, even censoring [the mention of censorship](https://substack.com/redirect/83ee554c-b4a5-4496-a792-8ab603c124e1?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) itself.
> 
> And despite instituting free elections, the US and Japan banned the Communist Party and blacklisted all its members. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/gmail-how-to-solve-the-israel-palestine-problem-18bafed33e2#be7a2c2c-d837-4581-a000-d63321287547) 

> ### Your Role
> 
> One of the reasons the Israeli-Palestinian conflict receives so much international publicity is because we are its judge, and we can nudge it in one direction or the other. As I mentioned in _[Will Israel Be at War?](https://substack.com/redirect/bfa5d367-cf63-487a-80a5-1f85bc33f836?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE)_, this land is too weak to be independent. It has always depended on its surrounding empires. Today, those are mainly Western and Arab powers, and their opinions will influence the future of the region.²⁰
> 
> That’s why it’s so important that each of us works to push the region towards moderation. 
> 
> 1. When you find people claiming issues are black or white, explain the **complexity** of the situation if you know it, or simply point out that it’s complicated if you don’t.
> 2. **Empathize** with both sides: Validate their suffering, but not their hatred.
> 3. Call out **whataboutism**, where people justify their side’s actions because of the bad from the other side.
> 4. Call out **misinformation** when you find it. When somebody denies that information is true—like whether Hamas beheaded babies, or whether the IDF kills Palestinian civilians—look for evidence if you can. There are some places dedicated to analyzing misinformation. Follow them.
> 5. Nothing brings a group to moderation better than moderates within that group. So if you’re a moderate, call out your side before the other’s.
> 
> This is a game that extremists have played better than moderates. It’s time to change that.²¹ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/gmail-how-to-solve-the-israel-palestine-problem-18bafed33e2#b9386047-e470-4996-b19c-6ce2f94b52f8) 

> ### An Even Brighter Future
> 
> Luckily, there are four other factors that will probably make peace easier in the future.
> 
> 1. Solar energy costs are dropping about [12%](https://substack.com/redirect/843791d2-5322-445f-87e2-ece297e4f5cd?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) cheaper per year. That means they halve every five years. The Israeli desert receives a lot of sunlight, so the value of desert land is increasing as a source of energy. Since a big chunk of the land Israel wanted to swap to Palestine was desert, now these land swaps are much more valuable to Palestinians. They can generate more energy with them, and even more every year.
> 2. As the cost of solar energy drops, so does the cost of desalination. It’s now about [$0.5](https://substack.com/redirect/9684727c-d36d-40a3-82fd-c0a428bc1394?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) per ton of water, and since energy is the biggest cost, the cost of desalination decreases with the cost of solar energy. Therefore, desert lands will be easier and cheaper to irrigate, and since they’re usually naturally fertile, growing crops should be easier in the future.
> 3. As solar power increases in production, the power of oil producers will diminish, including Iran, one of the biggest agents of turmoil in the region. In a decade, its income from oil will probably falter, and with it the ability to foster conflict.
> 4. Fertility [has been dropping](https://substack.com/redirect/e5fee089-2647-4b1c-a821-9042cd78d11b?j=eyJ1IjoiZTc3emEifQ.ymfH59MgiShJB-L3UEIYS8ZVhT%5FGqb94oSI2A5VuozE) on the Palestinian side. Normally, young people are more likely to support war and terrorism, and older people prefer peace. The aging Palestinian population should naturally moderate its views.
> 
> More moderate populations, more valuable land, and less foreign influence should help Israelis and Palestinians find a long-lasting peace. If, on top of that, everybody is educated to understand each other and empathize, they will be able to reach peace.
