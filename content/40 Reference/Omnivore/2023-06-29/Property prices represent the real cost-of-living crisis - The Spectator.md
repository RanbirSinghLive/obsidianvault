## Highlights

> Over the 34 years of my working life, I have seen human ingenuity, technology and globalisation combine to develop products and services which offer much greater value for money. Televisions, cars, food, cafés, restaurants, clothing, air travel, telephony and domestic appliances have all become better and more affordable. There are lots of good reasons why you may wish to go back in time, but shopping, like dentistry, isn’t one of them.
> 
> Many modern goods are also bizarrely egalitarian. Someone on well below medium income can own a phone which, only four years previously, was the best in the world. And it comes with a free camera which not long ago would have cost £1,000.
