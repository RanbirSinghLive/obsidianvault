## Highlights

> When I checked into the Peninsula hotel with my mother on one of our trips to Asia in the 1990s, the elderly elevator operator recognized my mother from 1949\. He was a teenage refugee back then and had stayed working at the hotel through the years, eventually becoming an elevator operator.
> 
> My mother told him she was glad she could come back and that the hotel was still as beautifully kept as ever. The old elevator operator had a grand smile and tears in his eyes. I noticed that the elevator had new electric buttons and no inner cage door or hand lever, so I wondered why there was an operator. My mother explained that the hotel knew there was nowhere for old workers like him to go, so they let him stay on and push the buttons.
