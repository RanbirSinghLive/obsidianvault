## Highlights

> Whether you prefer to call it genius or providence (Rick Rubin says The Beatles are the single best argument for the existence of God), the dream lasted for the best part of a decade. In _Get Back_ we meet the group in the midst of waking up from it, the spell wearing off. When they throw a pack of cards in the air, they can no longer rely on a castle magically assembling itself. It turns out they can’t set up a record label and wait for the money to roll in, and it’s looking very much like they can’t make a TV spectacular from scratch in a few weeks. It also turns out that there’s more than two songwriters in the band and more than four people in the friendship group.

> The closing sequence is from that last day. An exhausted contentment prevails. They play the same few songs over and over and over: _Two of Us, Long and Winding Road, Let It Be_. They start to look bored, glassy-eyed, and the silly voices creep in, but they keep going. As they begin yet another run-through of _Let It Be_, we get one of those magical subtitles that signify _this is it_ \- this is the take we’ve been listening to all these years.

> When it comes to an end, John, who is sitting on the floor with his guitar, says, “I thought that was rather grand. I’d take one home with me.” Paul asks Glyn if it was good enough. Glyn says yes. Paul says, “We’ll do one more, just to cover ourselves.” John has a grumble, puts his cigarette out, and gets ready to go again.
