## Highlights

> If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#e95844ef-02eb-4542-b4cb-0bb91bb6a276) 

> For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#9abe6d91-374c-446c-85a6-71935fa601aa) 

> Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can't make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#3691f983-c61c-49e5-8de0-4326025a1178) 

> **The Pie Fallacy**
> 
> A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of _money_ at any moment. But that's not the same thing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#e0de8cfd-49d8-42ce-af2d-7668a2fee2a0) 

> A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don't see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#c044d1ef-0b7b-4f89-aa35-2a9b3b54be56) 

> That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#aec62e55-c6bb-4535-a6ca-d1400ebdcc97) 

> Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was _run upstairs._Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#63902d61-0a7d-4d77-866f-723921143d84) 

> I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client's assets into one volatile stock? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#596fde99-1c4e-43b1-923f-6e35e4750ec1) 

> You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.
> 
> In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you've created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren't using your software, maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's because you haven't made what they want. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#b03dde31-5052-416b-9708-a1c5ea9364c9) 

> wealth had a bad reputation.
> 
> Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. \[[10](#f10n)\]Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#797f0242-b095-4908-8716-e72471687bb8) 

> Remember what a startup is, economically: a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#b52affbb-8ffe-4028-af50-f477a56ac711) 

> The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly. It's that it tends not to happen at all. It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#cdfcce58-c0f5-4009-a2ee-b245a403e1a9) 

> Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.
> 
> Once you're allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.
> 
> In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#d969ce3c-66e3-4089-b4c7-99103b7debe3) 

> If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you're even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#364000e3-82b2-42ba-8741-61c62c5d73ba) 

> It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-flight-beehiiv-net-v-2-clicks-ey-jhb-gci-oi-ji-uz-i-1-ni-i-189f73c6ca4#bbee671b-8e85-4e87-826b-4cbf8c299f33)
