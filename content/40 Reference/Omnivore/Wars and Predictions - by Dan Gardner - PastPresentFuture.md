## Highlights

> Dwight Eisenhower famously said, “every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” He was right. But Eisenhower also built many guns, warships, and rockets. 
> 
> Because Eisenhower understood that weakness invites war. Because he understood strength prevents war. And because he understood that the only thing worse than spending money on weapons is being unprepared for war.
