## Highlights

> 3\. [Moravec's Paradox](https://www.ai.nl/artificial-intelligence/moravecs-paradox-explained-in-five-levels-of-difficulty-with-practical-examples/):
> 
> What is easy for humans is hard for AI, and vice versa. Differential calculus requires far less compute than merely climbing steps. Thus, AI may replace most white collar jobs before it replaces most blue collar ones. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#5ec24507-a010-453c-adb1-88017a3af99d) 

> 11\. [Dartmouth Scar](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232481827%5FPerceptions%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fimpact%5Fof%5Fnegatively%5Fvalued%5Fcharacteristics%5Fon%5Fsocial%5Finteraction):
> 
> Kleck (1980) told his research subjects they’d engage in a study to test discrimination. He painted scars on some of their faces, and then had them attend job interviews. The participants with scars painted on their faces reported feeling discriminated against for their looks. However, unknown to them, their scars had been removed before they entered the interviews.
> 
> It would seem we can be victimized by the mere belief that we’re a victim. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#4a246c02-508d-4607-ac48-97bb137c55f7) 

> 1. [Crazy Bastard Hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513813000950):
> 
> Why do young men commonly endanger their lives with reckless behavior? Fessler et al (2014) found that people view risk-prone men as larger and stronger. Thus, seemingly crazy male behavior may actually be a fitness signal.
> 
> 16\. [Compounding](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement):
> 
> To win big, do small things consistently.
> 
> Since human brains think linearly, we vastly underestimate the exponential effects of cumulative small actions. In 2005, Canadian blogger [Kyle MacDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s3bdVxuFBs) traded his way from a paperclip to a house in just 14 transactions.

> 19\. [Problem Selling](https://twitter.com/BoyanSlat/status/1485615991660949508):
> 
> Problem-solvers take an issue and break it down into small solvable chunks. Problem-sellers (e.g. politicians, the press) do the opposite, blaming many small issues on one big problem that looks insurmountable and terrifying.
> 
> 20\. [Celine’s 2nd Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celine%27s%5Flaws):
> 
> Honest communication occurs only between equals.
> 
> If one person has power over another, then the less powerful person can’t risk saying what they really think. Thus, in any hierarchy, honest communication only travels horizontally. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#ddac9b4d-118c-4521-8e81-9c5c4f25046d) 

> [St. George in Retirement Syndrome](https://themindcollection.com/st-george-in-retirement-syndrome/):
> 
> Many who fight injustice come to define themselves by their fight against injustice, so that, as they defeat the injustice, they must invent new injustices to fight against simply to retain a sense of purpose in life. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#66776418-7765-441d-810c-dc0c8daac93c) 

> [Gurwinder’s Theory of Bespoke Bullshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0):
> 
> Many don’t have an opinion until they’re asked for it, at which point they cobble together a viewpoint from whim &amp; half-remembered hearsay, before deciding that this 2-minute-old makeshift opinion will be their new hill to die on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#7dfa5184-1a1f-443c-935b-6abd94d65d2f) 

> 33\. [Shopping Cart Theory](https://medium.com/be-unique/the-curious-case-of-the-shopping-cart-theory-802909d93cff):
> 
> Returning a shopping cart is considerate, quick, and easy, so it’s an extremely low bar of unselfishness to clear. Therefore, someone who doesn't return shopping carts without good reason (e.g. disability) likely has the principles of an alley cat, and is only being kept in check by laws. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#5b0776a5-0d6b-4ab7-a59a-0a0fb6d63c23) 

> [The Arc of Happiness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-020-00797-z):
> 
> Self-reported happiness graphed by age is smile-shaped. The optimism of youth becomes cynicism as responsibilities mount &amp; dreams collide with reality. But after midlife, happiness rises again as people accept reality and learn to enjoy the little things.
>

> Epistemic Luck:
> 
> You know that if you’d lived in a different place or time, read different books, had different friends, you’d have different beliefs. And yet, you’re convinced that your current beliefs are correct. So, are you wrong, or the luckiest person ever? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-gurwinder-p-40-mind-expanding-concep-188cfdfe0c2#19900fac-a743-4a94-b059-f7544143a541)
