## Highlights

> I would actually argue, forging a company is a lot harder than forging a product. Basic reason is [people are irrational](https://genius.com/5189923/Keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate/People-are-irrational). We all know this. Either your parents, your significant other, your brother or sister, your teacher, somebody in your life is irrational. Building a company is basically like taking all the irrational people you know putting them in one building, and then living with them twelve hours a day at least. It's very challenging.

> [As Warren Buffett says, build a company that idiots could run because eventually they will.](https://genius.com/4316818/Keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate/As-warren-buffett-says-build-a-company-that-idiots-could-run-because-eventually-they-will) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate-genius-18afdb92854#c1c3c5e7-5724-4ab1-a286-31d4dff8e71a) 

> [Basically eliminating things, the biggest task of an editor is to simplify, simplify, simplify and that usually means omitting things](https://genius.com/4552370/Keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate/Basically-eliminating-things-the-biggest-task-of-an-editor-is-to-simplify-simplify-simplify-and-that-usually-means-omitting-things). So that's your job too, is to clarify and simplify for everybody on your team. The more you simplify, the better people will perform. People can not understand and keep track of a long complicated set of initiatives. [So you have to distill it down to one, two, or three things and use a framework they can repeat, they can repeat without thinking about, they can repeat to their friends, they can repeat at night.](https://genius.com/4552446/Keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate/So-you-have-to-distill-it-down-to-one-two-or-three-things-and-use-a-framework-they-can-repeat-they-can-repeat-without-thinking-about-they-can-repeat-to-their-friends-they-can-repeat-at-night) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate-genius-18afdb92854#4ca1ca1d-6596-4f02-abc1-0e94050fc884) 

> Second thing editors do, is they ask you clarifying questions. When you present a paper to someone, what do they usually do? They find some ambiguity somewhere and ask, do you really mean this? Did you really mean that? Give me an example of this? That's what your job is.
