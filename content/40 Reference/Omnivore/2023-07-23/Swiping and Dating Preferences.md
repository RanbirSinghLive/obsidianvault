## Highlights

> If you are a typical male, don’t just do what comes naturally. Which is probably nothing, or close to nothing. You have to battle your own nature and go out of your way to pretend to be a decent and caring human being. This might not come naturally. But you’ll feel better if you do it, because you’re making your romantic partner feel better.

> Being productive and resourceful is critical for a man’s self-image and social standing. Most (though not all) men implicitly understand that they are only valuable insofar as they bring resources to the table (literally and figuratively). In _Suicide: The Social Causes of Self-Destruction_, the sociologist Jason Manning reports that people who lose their jobs are more likely to kill themselves in the subsequent year than those who have not lost their jobs. This effect, though, is particularly strong for men: those who lose jobs are 2-3 times more likely to have killed themselves.

> When my late adoptive grandparents met back in the 1950s, after about 2 weeks, my 21-year-old grandfather proposed to my 18-year-old grandmother. She replied that she had 3 requirements for him: stop smoking, stop drinking, and stop gambling. My grandfather agreed, immediately dropping all 3 habits (and never returning to them). Today, it is laughable to imagine such a scenario occurring in the U.S. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/swiping-and-dating-preferences-1898236d5dd#9c2fd6dd-ead0-42ad-ad01-0265967d1efc)
