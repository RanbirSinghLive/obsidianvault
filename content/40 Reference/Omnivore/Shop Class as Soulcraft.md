## Highlights

> Boasting is what a boy does, who has no real effect in the world. But craftsmanship must reckon with the infallible judgment of reality, where one’s failures or shortcomings cannot be interpreted away. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-e-5-ux-929-x-6-lb-7-hp-5-ewzdc-8-18bcc06c1ec#b31fa84d-e987-42cd-868b-7856ebc62692) 

> More fundamentally, the durable objects of use produced by men “give rise to the familiarity of the world, its customs and habits of intercourse between men and things as well as between men and men,” as Hannah Arendt says. “The reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on the fact that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by which they were produced, and potentially even more permanent than the lives of their authors.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-e-5-ux-929-x-6-lb-7-hp-5-ewzdc-8-18bcc06c1ec#e8919a57-01d7-4b17-a25f-f2767be10fae) 

> As Sennett argues, most people take pride in being good at something specific, which happens through the accumulation of experience. Yet the flitting disposition is pressed upon workers from above by the current generation of management revolutionaries, for whom the ethic of craftsmanship is actually something to be rooted out from the workforce. Craftsmanship means dwelling on a task for a long time and going deeply into it, because one wants to get it right. In management-speak, this is called being “ingrown.” The preferred role model is the management consultant, who swoops in and out, and whose very pride lies in his lack of particular expertise. Like the ideal consumer, the management consultant presents an image of soaring freedom, in light of which the manual trades appear cramped and paltry.
