## Highlights

> There’s a thing in the legal world called Gibson’s Law, which states that, “For every PhD there is an equal and opposite PhD.” No matter what argument you’re trying to make, you can find a qualified expert witness who’s willing to make it, under oath, for $500 an hour. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-you-believe-the-things-you-do-collab-fund-18942ff113c#4644877c-68ae-4a2b-b0fb-dc220adbc503) 

> Memories of past events are filtered. You keep what makes sense and throw out the confusing details. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-you-believe-the-things-you-do-collab-fund-18942ff113c#0babe7c6-03f5-4bd9-8d8b-336d3df46a7c) 

> It is far easier to fool yourself into believing a falsehood than admit a mistake. Changing your mind is rarer than it should be, leading us to cling to false beliefs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-you-believe-the-things-you-do-collab-fund-18942ff113c#90a66725-afca-4b9c-8c93-49a4d885b43d) 

> A lot of times we’re not interested in truth – we’re interested in the elimination of uncertainty, and that fact alone causes us to believe things that have little relation to reality.
