## Highlights

> Bitcoin should be the ultimate battleground between the individual and the state. Yet the conflict over Bitcoin has quickly become quite tame (despite some initial saber rattling and legal wrangling). Bitcoin exists. The government allows it to exist. Banks love it.

Its users (mostly) pay their taxes. Everyone proceeds apace. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-end-of-online-history-18e7b5ddc16#2151fe99-ddcb-4b71-b898-78169a1b8e4b)
