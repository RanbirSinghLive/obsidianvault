## Highlights

> Are crowds smart or dumb? You may have heard the terms “wisdom of the crowds” and the “madness of crowds.” The former idea is that the collective opinion of a group of people is often more accurate than any individual person, and that gathering input from many individuals averages out the errors of each person and produces a more accurate answer. In contrast, the “madness of crowds” captures the idea that, relative to a single individual, large numbers of people are more likely to indulge their passions and get carried away by impulsive or destructive behaviors. So, which concept more accurately reflects reality?
> 
> _Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgement_ by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein provides the answer. The authors share research indicating that “independence is a prerequisite for the wisdom of crowds.” That is, if you want to use crowdsourcing to produce accurate information, you have to ensure that people make their judgments in private. If people provide their answers in a public setting where they can see everyone else’s answers, then the crowd can transform wisdom into madness.

> Bias refers to judgments that depart from rationality in consistent, predictable ways. If you ask people to estimate the likelihood of dying in a plane crash, you can predict their answers will generally be biased upward because airline accidents are so vividly covered in the media and readily come to mind (the availability bias). In contrast, noise means that judgments are unpredictable, or scattered. If you ask a group of people to guess the weight of a bull, their answers will not be biased. They will be _noisy_, meaning they all depart from the true weight of the bull in unforeseeable ways.

> Most organizations prefer consensus and harmony over dissent and conflict. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/daniel-kahneman-s-final-exploration-of-human-error-18e93fc3558#52bde5d3-e45c-4614-b666-549377c56b2b) 

> As Kahneman and his colleagues point out, many organizations consider conflict avoidance to be at least as important as optimal decision-making. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/daniel-kahneman-s-final-exploration-of-human-error-18e93fc3558#29abfd00-a3db-4b0e-bce9-b4ba01e27a0b) 

> “We do not always produce identical judgments when faced with the same facts on two occasions … _you are not the same person at all times_.” That is, as your mood and external circumstances vary, some features of your cognitive machinery vary too. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/daniel-kahneman-s-final-exploration-of-human-error-18e93fc3558#1cad3f1f-aac5-4964-867f-610e26ef2d63) 

> The book states that “As humans, we are keenly aware that we make mistakes, but that is a privilege we are not prepared to share. We expect machines to be perfect.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/daniel-kahneman-s-final-exploration-of-human-error-18e93fc3558#9c1af16a-ed3e-4e7a-b02d-a4420d674116) 

> Still, there are many reasons why raters might not want to be honest about a person’s true performance. They might assess people “strategically” in order to avoid a difficult discussion, to favor a person who they believe deserves a long-awaited promotion, or to get rid of an underperforming employee who needs a good evaluation to be transferred to another division. Such hidden motives can introduce noise into important decisions. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/daniel-kahneman-s-final-exploration-of-human-error-18e93fc3558#829fe796-7d43-470f-a3da-22902686e60e) 

> Many people who plead for exceptions really do believe they are exceptional. But for many decision-makers, they encounter people asking for such exceptional requests all the time.
