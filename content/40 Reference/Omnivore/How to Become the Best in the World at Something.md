## Highlights

> After four intense hours, he finished the test. As he sighed in relief, a red alert started blinking furiously on the screen. YOUR RESULTS ARE IN.
> 
> He scored in the 90th percentile on the math portion, and in the 95th percentile on the verbal portion. _Does that mean I’m in the 92nd percentile?! Oh nooo!_ He was dismayed. His heart sank. Those scores wouldn’t cut it. Goodbye, Stanford.
> 
> But then he looked closer. He saw something else: His overall score was **in the 98th percentile**. _What?!_ _How was this possible?_
> 
> Most math-minded test-takers are bad with words, and the word-loving ones can’t quite hack the fractions. So while my friend’s score wasn’t the best in any one section, it was among the best when these sections were considered _in combination_.
> 
> This is how skill stacking works. It’s easier and more effective to be in the top 10% in several different skills—your “stack”—than it is to be in the top 1% in any one skill. Take a look at this chart. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-unchartedterritories-tomaspueyo-com-p-how-to-become-the-be-18e30a2c9c8#9d1016fb-6122-4d2d-a4ee-72a82ca2c5af) 

> ## What Is Your Special Skill Stack?
> 
> How can you apply this to yourself?
> 
> In discovering your own skill stack, consider the combination of skills. You want them to be related in some way, but not too similar. For example, if you’re in the top 1% in journalism, also being in the top 1% in writing skills isn’t going to be a big differentiator. Most top journalists are good writers. What’s different about stacking is having skills that not only work together but also are varied enough to make you stand out.

> If anybody ever told you to stop following your passions, to stop being a “_Jack of All Trade, Master of None_”, tell them it’s “_Jack of Some Trades, Master of One”_.
