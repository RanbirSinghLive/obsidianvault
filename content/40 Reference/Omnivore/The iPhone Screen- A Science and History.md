## Highlights

> (Jobs’ response here is up there with the time he wanted the iPod to be made smaller but the engineering team told him it was impossible; so, Jobs took an iPod and dropped it in an aquarium and when the device floated to the top he said, [“Those are air bubbles…that means there’s space in there…make it smaller."](https://link.workweek.com/click/32654543.33166/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVpbmdndXJ1LmNvbS93aHktc3RldmUtam9icy10aHJldy10aGUtZmlyc3QtaXBvZC1wcm90b3R5cGUtaW50by10aGUtd2F0ZXIvIzp-OnRleHQ9VGhleSUyMGFsc28lMjB0b2xkJTIwSm9icyUyMHRoYXQsYXJlJTIwYWlyJTIwYnViYmxlcyUyQyUyMGhlJTIwc25hcHBlZC4/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873B6a59f9bb)) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-i-phone-screen-a-science-and-history-18a797ded45#562f7a8c-51e4-4af7-8916-45e16dd2fe22) 

> _Manufactured through a process of extreme heating and rapid cooling, tempered glass is much harder than standard glass. \[…\]_
> 
> _The glass is heated in a furnace to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and then quickly cooled using high-pressure air blasts. This cools the outer layers of the glass much more quickly than the internal layers, so when the inside cools, it pulls away from the outer layers. As a result, the inside remains in a state of tension, while the outside goes into a state of compression. These competing forces are what make tempered glass so much stronger than \[standard\] glass._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-i-phone-screen-a-science-and-history-18a797ded45#aa2b0570-ca84-45fa-9237-e580e46095f2)
