## Highlights

> For half a century, the average GPA at Harvard stayed constant at roughly 2.5\. By 1960, it had climbed to 3.0\. Today, it's up to 3.8\. GPAs aren't rising because students have gotten so much smarter. It's because teachers have lowered their standards. One of my college professors admitted that he secretly inflates his students' grades because it's easier to dish out a few extra points than put up with a nagging student. If nudging somebody from a B to a B+ brings peace of mind by getting the complaining student out of their office faster, it's worth the decline in rigor. Humans who are incentivized to improve numbers on a screen will eventually fudge the data. The more one party fudges, the more other ones will be incentivized to do the same.

> Experimenting, more than planning, leads to increased knowledge and greater progress. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/friday-finds-gpt-inflation-elites-nassim-taleb-189331ffeb7#79ba56bb-0196-407d-b5d5-fd607e57ad2d)
