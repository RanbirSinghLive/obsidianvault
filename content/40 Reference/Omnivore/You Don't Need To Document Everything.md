## Highlights

> And that truly empowered people don’t depend on external validation for every feeling or opinion or decision they make. Isn’t that just a basic rule in life? That those who are the loudest about their achievements and relationships and morality often have the most doubts about them? And if I know one thing it’s that if you’re experiencing a genuinely moving moment, if you’re really _in it,_ the absolute last thing you want or think about doing is taking out your phone, cutting through it and cheapening it. The best love is quiet. The best confidence is quiet. And so are the lives with the most meaning.
