## Highlights

> In fact, the oldest surviving map of the world (circa 600 BC) is symbolic, as opposed to literal. Aligned with local religious views of the time, the [Babylonian Map of the World](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W%5F1882-0714-509) depicts the world as a circle surrounded by water, and deliberately omits peoples who were well known to the Babylonians, such as the Egyptians and the Persians.

> Common visual symbols:
> 
> * **Pictogram.** A symbol that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object.
> * **Ideogram.** A graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept, independent of specific words or phrases.
> * **Logogram.** A written character that represents a word or phrase. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/thinking-in-maps-from-the-lascaux-caves-to-knowledge-graphs-189fee9c82e#395b49f4-79b8-4e4f-b76b-69ee5ae907bc) 

> Today, many languages use an alphabetic system (latin, cyrillic, greek, armenian, georgian, hangul), an abjad (similar to the twenty-four ancient Egyptian glyphs, a writing system in which each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving it to the reader to infer the vowels; these include Arabic and Hebrew), or an alphasyllabary (where vowels are denoted by diacritical marks, such as Sanskrit and Thai). However, 1.4 billion people still use a logographic system, where symbols are combined together to create meaning.
> 
> For instance, in Chinese, 休 xiū “rest” is composed of 人 rén “person” and 木 mù “tree”. Of course, thousands of years of evolution means that modern Chinese speakers cannot rely on simply deciphering each part of a logogram to guess its meaning. You will find the logogram 每 in the characters 海 “sea”, 侮 “to humiliate”, and 悔 “to regret”—which is not particularly helpful.

> In [The Polymath: Unlocking the Power of Human Versatility](https://amzn.to/2zpmmH7) by Waqās Ahmed, art historian Martin Kemp is quoted remarking: “One of the characteristics you will find of polymaths is that they see links where we see separations—for Leonardo everything is linked up.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/thinking-in-maps-from-the-lascaux-caves-to-knowledge-graphs-189fee9c82e#2975f528-7ceb-43aa-afde-4d1541c79967) 

> More recently, and outside the scientific realm, this intricate map based on Walt Disney’s vision of the interconnected relationship between his company’s business units was included in an internal presentation by a Disney executive in 1957\. What makes this map particularly interesting is its emphasis on dynamic relationships rather than static links.
