## Highlights

> The novel matters because there is still no artform that more thoroughly plumbs human consciousness. Artificial intelligence can write lousy novels or plagiarized novels, but not those that speak to what it means, in a passing moment, to be alive. Novels offer ambition on a range not plausible in the land of screens because there is no budget required, no gimmick or technological mastery—it is raw imagination, the greatest achievement of humankind, and it’s the print books that will outlast us, not an internet vulnerable to revision, corrosion, and collapse. It might be time to know, again, the interiority of men, American men, in all of their joys, lusts, indignities, mundanities, and horrors. What is ticking inside the American male of the mid-2020s and what can novelists tell us about that? What is today’s Rabbit Angstrom or Frank Bascombe like? What might the Patrick Bateman born in 1997 be up to? And what of those far below, fully denied wealth and status, the men barely working or not working at all? The incels, the volcels, the MGTOWs? The gambling addicts and the gamers? Those who, instead of Hemingway, wish to be Rogan? The Latino and Black men drawn to Trump? The Asian men [who do not](https://salieriredemption.substack.com/p/asian-american-psycho?utm%5Fsource=publication-search), in fact, want to master the SAT? There’s a strange, teeming world out there. Literature can’t—and shouldn’t—be blind to it. If it’s going to be complete and speak to this era of tumult, it must find a way to those who aren’t near books at all. It must expand.
