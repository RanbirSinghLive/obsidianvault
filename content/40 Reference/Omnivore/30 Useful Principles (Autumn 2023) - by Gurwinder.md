## Highlights

> #### [Goodhart’s Law](https://www.cna.org/reports/2022/09/goodharts-law):
> 
> When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to be a good measure. 
> 
> Since schools started to use test-scores as targets, they’ve gradually stopped teaching kids how to live fulfilling lives, and now mainly teach them how to pass school tests (See also: [Campbell’s Law](https://educationalendeavors.substack.com/p/campbells-law-something-every-educator)).

> ####  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#66596ebc-5bb6-46f5-ae34-c025d376e40a) 

> #### [Segal’s Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9Ds84AW68E):
> 
> “A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with 2 watches is never sure.”
> 
> Ancient societies followed a single narrative. Modern societies are cacophonies of competing narratives. Without trust, more data doesn’t make us more informed but more confused. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#c73a047b-bf70-4015-aa42-03cdca0eb87e) 

> #### [The Reading Recession](https://www.statista.com/chart/27287/average-hours-spent-per-day-by-americans-reading-for-pleasure/):
> 
> There is more text than ever, yet people are reading ever less and outsourcing writing to chatbots. This is dangerous because language is the basis of thought, and if you can’t read or write well, you won’t think well. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#53b94ef1-b085-49e3-9dc2-b507cc4ecb78) 

> #### [Parkinson's Law](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191107-the-law-that-explains-why-you-cant-get-anything-done):
> 
> Work expands to fill the time allotted for it. No matter the size of the task, it will often take precisely the amount of time you set aside to do it, because more time means more deliberation & procrastination.
> 
> _The underlying principle, known as induced demand, applies to many other resources: Software expands to fill memory ([Wirth’s law](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24381/wirths-law)), patients expand to fill hospital beds ([Roemer's law](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572098/)), energy consumption expands to meet supply ([Jevon’s paradox](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23251042.2015.1106060)), road congestion expands to fill roads ([Braess’ paradox](https://brilliant.org/wiki/braess-paradox/))._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#34cb0c51-67a9-4519-b7d0-942fa5987de2) 

> #### [Safetyism](https://theopolisinstitute.com/leithart%5Fpost/safetyism-is-unsafe/):
> 
> After US schools banned peanuts because some kids had allergies, more kids developed peanut allergies from lack of exposure. We’re increasingly protecting kids from life, which only makes them more vulnerable to it. Too much safety is dangerous. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#3ab47051-32a3-49b8-aaee-08aa03b01771) 

> #### [Cynical Genius Illusion](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167218783195):
> 
> Cynical people are widely seen as smarter, but sizable research suggests they actually tend to be dumber. Cynicism is not a sign of intelligence but a substitute for it, a way to shield oneself from betrayal & disappointment without having to do or think. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#36ea1958-a89d-46b7-8d46-992a586aae1b) 

> #### [Substitution Hypothesis](https://boghossian.substack.com/p/poetry-of-reality-richard-dawkins):
> 
> We’re wired for faith, so as we kill the old gods, we create new ones to replace them. New Atheism gave rise to Atheism+, a quasi-religion dedicated to “social justice”. In the spiritual void left by receding religion, many now worship "wokeness", with a new Original Sin (whiteness) and Holy Trinity (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#4d961c13-f4d8-4e73-86c6-a4ae2aadf3e2) 

> #### 22\. [Ambiguity Aversion](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160329101037.htm):
> 
> People tend to find uncertain outcomes less tolerable than bad outcomes. De Berker et al (2016) found that test participants who were told they had a small chance of receiving an electric shock exhibited much higher stress levels than those who knew they’d certainly receive an electric shock. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-30-useful-principles-autumn-2023--18c08de9992#e6f6651e-205f-4511-b643-15015f43b5ca) 

> #### [Toothbrush Problem](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-toothbrush-problem):
> 
> Psychologists treat theories like toothbrushes; no self-respecting person wants to use another’s. Theorists are incentivized by ego and professional pressures to overly rely on their own theories, so they often ignore the best models in favor of their own, applying them ever more widely, contorting them till they’re warped.

> #### [Ferguson Effect](https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-evidence-for-the-ferguson-effect):
> 
> Black Lives Matter activism reduced policing of black communities, causing murder rates to spike, and a net loss of thousands of black lives. BLM activists insist this effect is a myth, but multiple recent studies, such as [Cheng & Long (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272721001936) and [Campbell (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119023000578), suggest it’s real.
