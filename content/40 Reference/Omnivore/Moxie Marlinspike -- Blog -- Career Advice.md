## Highlights

> As a young person, though, I think the best thing you can do is to ignore all of that and simply _observe the older people working there_.
> 
> They are the future you. Do not think that you will be substantially different. Look carefully at how they spend their time at work and outside of work, because this is also almost certainly how your life will look. It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often young people imagine a different projection for themselves.
> 
> Look at the real people, and you’ll see the honest future for yourself. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-link-workweek-com-click-32954756-33149-a-hr-0-c-hm-6-ly-9--18b11606b2a#f5fcee21-c474-4088-b527-931a856b5abc) 

> The instant you get out of prison you have the sensation that you are leaving something dear to you. Why? Because you know that you are leaving a part of your life inside, because you spent some of your life there which, even if it was under terrible conditions, is still a part of you. And even if you lived it badly and suffered horribly, which is not always the case, it is always better than the nothing that your life is reduced to the moment it disappears.
