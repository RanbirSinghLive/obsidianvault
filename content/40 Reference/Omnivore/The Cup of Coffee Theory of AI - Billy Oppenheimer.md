## Highlights

> Art preferences are similar. So when I hear talk about how AI is going to replace artists, I think to myself, the world is big enough for both. Or when I see tweets about how AI wrote this “great” article or produced this “great” image, I ask myself, “great”—according to whom?
> 
> Countless authors, painters, and inventors who were considered ordinary in their own time are revered in ours. And anyone who has made and released creative work has experienced something analogous to making a delicious espresso for an audience that prefers a French press.

> Jerry Seinfeld identified as the [ultimate skill of the artist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/11/30/lorne-michaels-kennedy-center-honors/): “taste and discernment.”  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-billyoppenheimer-com-the-cup-of-coffee-theory-18aeb30fd79#d4e5d89e-70db-4c62-bb69-aaa7f7269f6e) 

> The tools will no doubt get better at pulling relevant quotes. But I’m less confident they’ll ever solve the perennial mysteries of taste and discernment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-billyoppenheimer-com-the-cup-of-coffee-theory-18aeb30fd79#4d90e96f-7298-4bb5-bc42-bcd6fee82511) 

> Artists who get so famous that they can’t go out in public talk about how not being able to do so makes it hard to create art that connects. To come up with material for _Seinfeld,_ for instance, Seinfeld and co-creator Larry David liked to hang out in public settings where they could observe and eavesdrop on strangers. As the show became a cultural phenomenon, Seinfeld and David couldn’t go out in public like they used to. Strangers didn’t act like strangers around them. This slow detachment from humanity made it harder to make a show that connected with humanity.
