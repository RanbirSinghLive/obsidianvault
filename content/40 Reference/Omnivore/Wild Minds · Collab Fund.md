## Highlights

> John Boyd was probably the greatest fighter pilot to ever live.
> 
> He revolutionized his field more than anyone before or since. A manual he wrote, _Aerial Attack Study_, incorporated as much math into the science of fighting maneuvers as engineers used in building the planes.
> 
> His insights were simple but powerful. In one, Boyd realized a tactical advantage was not how fast or high a plane could fly, but how quickly it could change course and begin climbing – a discovery that changed not only how pilots thought, but how planes were built. He was as close to a flying savant as they come. Boyd’s manual, written in his 20s, became the official tactics guide of fighter pilots. It’s still used today.

> Something I’ve long thought true, and shows up constantly when you look for it, is that people who are abnormally good at one thing tend to be abnormally bad at something else. It’s as if the brain only has capacity for so much knowledge and emotion, and an abnormal skill robs bandwidth from other parts of someone’s personality.
