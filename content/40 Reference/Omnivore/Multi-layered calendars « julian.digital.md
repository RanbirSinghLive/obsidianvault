## Highlights

> My personal workflow looks like this:
> 
> * I treat my email inbox as my primary task manager (and note-taking tool).
> * Tasks are emails I receive from others or emails I send to myself.
> * I snooze emails until the week I want to get them done.
> * At the beginning of each week, I go through my email todo list and block time in my calendar for each task. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/multi-layered-calendars-julian-digital-1896300484f#9a4042e8-e120-46b8-98af-5c61a7dc1377) 

> **2\. You need to travel to and back from your meeting**  
> To ensure that no other meetings are scheduled during those travel times, you added two “do not schedule” blocks (DNS). These are neither meetings nor tasks. Their only purpose is to avoid conflicts with other upcoming events. 
> 
> The DNS blocks appear before and after the meeting, but what they really represent is one entire layer of time that stretches from 10:30 to 12:30\. Your conversation with Mike is a **meeting layer** _on top_ of your **blocked time layer**.

> The takeaway of this essay is twofold:
> 
> * Calendars should natively differentiate between different types of calendar events. Tasks, meetings, blocked time, and other activities should look and behave differently depending on their respective attributes.
> * This would open the door for a virtually infinite amount of other use cases that could be integrated into the calendar experience in the form of unique calendar layers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/multi-layered-calendars-julian-digital-1896300484f#4d184666-2192-4c2d-b0aa-c5e2ba4e9e9f)
