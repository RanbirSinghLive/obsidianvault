## Highlights

> We agree with Paul Collier when he says, “Economic growth is not a cure-all, but lack of growth is a kill-all.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-techno-optimist-manifesto-andreessen-horowitz-18b3dacbcc2#cbf3a693-1aa5-4b4f-a578-2975afd856ef) 

> There are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology.
> 
> Developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may already be shrinking.
> 
> Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political.
> 
> And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-techno-optimist-manifesto-andreessen-horowitz-18b3dacbcc2#e05d8211-bee1-4227-80bb-010f6fc1c1f9) 

> We had a problem of starvation, so we invented the Green Revolution.
> 
> We had a problem of darkness, so we invented electric lighting.
> 
> We had a problem of cold, so we invented indoor heating.
> 
> We had a problem of heat, so we invented air conditioning.
> 
> We had a problem of isolation, so we invented the Internet.
> 
> We had a problem of pandemics, so we invented vaccines.
> 
> We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance.
> 
> Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-techno-optimist-manifesto-andreessen-horowitz-18b3dacbcc2#3cf724ae-e832-4106-b804-79364dbd0b7c) 

> We believe energy need not expand to the detriment of the natural environment. We have the silver bullet for virtually unlimited zero-emissions energy today – nuclear fission. In 1973, President Richard Nixon called for Project Independence, the construction of 1,000 nuclear power plants by the year 2000, to achieve complete US energy independence. Nixon was right; we didn’t build the plants then, but we can now, anytime we decide we want to.

> We believe Andy Warhol was right when he said, “What’s great about this country is America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.” Same for the browser, the smartphone, the chatbot.
