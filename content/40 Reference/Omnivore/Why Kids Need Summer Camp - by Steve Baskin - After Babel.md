## Highlights

> The decline of the play-based childhood was driven in large part by a novel parenting trend that reduces children’s resilience: overprotection.[1](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-kids-need-summer-camp?utm%5Fsource=multiple-personal-recommendations-email&utm%5Fmedium=email&triedRedirect=true#footnote-1-142546197) Overprotection changes the objective function of parenting from “preparation for life” to “protection from pain.” In short, if we completely shield our children from the struggles of life, then once they leave the nest they will have less capacity to adapt on their own and will experience more anxiety.[2](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/why-kids-need-summer-camp?utm%5Fsource=multiple-personal-recommendations-email&utm%5Fmedium=email&triedRedirect=true#footnote-2-142546197) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-kids-need-summer-camp-by-steve-baskin-after-babel-18e5d94fa72#437a882f-cfd7-496e-a74c-2c267a5f4e02)
