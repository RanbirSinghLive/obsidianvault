## Highlights

> Now, there are rare situations where an old person is perfectly fit for the moment. Churchill in World War 2 is the textbook example of this. But his age and experience was not what made him fit for that moment. It was being Churchill that made him fit for that moment. He had that proverbial dog in him that you need to be a wartime leader. It’s not like that dog suddenly developed when he was 60\. A 40 year old Churchill would have got the job done the same way a 65 year old Churchill did.
