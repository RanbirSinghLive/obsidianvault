## Highlights

> There are 5 steps to “The Algorithm”, which many SpaceX and Tesla employees have memorized. I will share them based on notes [I wrote from an interview Elon did with _Everyday Astronaut_](https://link.workweek.com/click/32730828.34425/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVhZHRydW5nLmNvbS9wL3NwYWNleHMtNS1zdGVwLWRlc2lnbi1wcm9jZXNz/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873B92efe88d):

> **1\. Make the requirement less dumb:** _“The requirements are definitely dumb; it does not matter who gave them to you. It’s particularly dangerous when they come from an intelligent person, as you may not question them. Everyone’s wrong. No matter what you are, everyone is wrong some of the time. All designs are wrong, it’s just a matter of how wrong. Whatever requirement or constraint you have, it must come with a name (not a department). Because you can’t ask the departments, you have to ask a person. The person putting forward the requirement must take responsibility for it. Otherwise you could have a requirement that basically an intern \[randomly came up with\] 2 years ago.”_ 
> 
> **2\. Try to delete part of the process:** _“If parts are not being added back to the design at least 10% of the time, \[it means that\] not enough parts are being deleted. The bias tends to be very strongly towards ‘let’s add this part or process step in case we need it.’ But you can basically make an ‘in case’ argument for so many things. And for a rocket that is trying to be the first fully re-usable rocket…you really need to run tight margins. Because if you don’t run tight margins, you will get nothing to orbit.”_ 
> 
> **3\. Simplify or optimize:** _“Simplify and optimize the design. The reason this is the third step and not the first step is because the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should simply not exist. Why would people do that? Well, everyone’s been trained in high school and college that you gotta answer the question. If you tell a professor ‘your question is dumb’, you will get a bad grade. You have to ask the the question \[whether something should exist or you will work on optimizing the thing that should simply not exist\].”_ 
> 
> **4\. Accelerate cycle time: _“_**_You’re moving too slowly, go faster. But don’t go faster until you’ve worked out the other three things first.”_
> 
> **5\. Automate:** _“Then the final step is automate it. Now, I have personally made the mistake of going backwards on all five steps multiple times. On the \[Tesla Model 3 battery pack manufacturing\], I automated, accelerated, simplified then deleted.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/6-thought-on-elon-musk-by-walter-isaacson-18a9d8a7f2c#1a8eac22-bce6-4dee-8e5b-83a5e5535907) 

> Isaacson notes that there are a number of “corollaries” to the Algorithm including:
> 
> * **All technical managers must have hands-on experience.** For example, managers of software teams must spend at least 20% of their time coding. Solar roof managers must spend time on the roofs doing installations.
> * **Camaraderie is dangerous.** It makes it hard for people to challenge each other’s work. There is a tendency to not want to throw a colleague under the bus. That needs to be avoided. It’s OK to be wrong. Just don’t be confident and wrong. Never ask your troops to do something you’re not willing to do.
> * **The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics.** Everything else is a recommendation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/6-thought-on-elon-musk-by-walter-isaacson-18a9d8a7f2c#5344b37b-b7a2-4408-a26b-ebb04c63296d) 

> The latches used by NASA in the Space Station cost $1,500 each. A SpaceX engineer was able to modify a latch used in a bathroom stall and create a locking mechanism that cost $30\. When an engineer came to Musk’s cubicle and told him that the air-cooling system for the payload bay of the Falcon 9 would cost more than $3 million, he shouted over to Gwynne Shotwell in her adjacent cubicle to ask what an air-conditioning system for a house cost. About $6,000, she said. So the SpaceX team bought some commercial air-conditioning units and modified their pumps so they could work atop the rocket.

> SpaceX is so far ahead of the field that it is on pace to send 80% of the global payload to orbit in 2023. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/6-thought-on-elon-musk-by-walter-isaacson-18a9d8a7f2c#5427f6bd-7f2b-4e2d-84ee-9d27b47b9685)
