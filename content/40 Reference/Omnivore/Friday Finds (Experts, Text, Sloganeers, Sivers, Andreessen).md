## Highlights

> **Experts Talking Like Experts:** I have a friend who's about to take his company public. He says that you know you're talking to a domain expert when you feel the need to frantically write down everything they're saying, because so much of it is new to you. Learning to recognize real expertise from fake expertise is a skill worth cultivating. It helps you sniff out the charlatans from people with serious game. I've picked up a few mantras: (1) great people speak in specifics, and (2) they're so comfortable talking about their craft that the rhythm and patterns of their speech don't change when they do.
