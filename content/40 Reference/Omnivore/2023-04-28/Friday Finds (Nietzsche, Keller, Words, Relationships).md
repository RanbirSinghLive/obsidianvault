## Highlights

> Borrowing from Darwin, Nietzsche didn't believe in the intrinsic value of humans (opposing the Christian idea that every human is made in the image of God and therefore has inherent value). Christian morality is service-based and self-sacrificial, which is why it focuses so much on kindness and compassion. Nietzsche had a darker interpretation though. Reading the Bible prompted him to ask, "Who's interests do these morals serve?" He claims that Christian morals serve the feeble, poor, weak, and inferior. Nietzsche dubbed Christian ethics as a "slave morality," saying that it was a way to take revenge on the strong and powerful people in Ancient Rome. He saw the story of Jesus as a way for the oppressed to oppress their oppressors. Nietzsche may have published [_Beyond Good and Evil_](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/k0udxrxdepb6hdl52xmbl/vqh3hrhpxer24wtw/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzQxVlRlUFA=)in 1886, but our fiercest debates today — from the purpose of education to who should pay for healthcare — point back to his 19th-century critique of Christianity and the clash of these Western systems of morality.
