## Highlights

> Most entrepreneurs in education build the wrong type of business, because entrepreneurs think of education as a quality problem. The average person thinks of it as a cost problem. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-92-un-0-w-0-n-4-xbnhqd-4-pvqi-9--18947c50359#361166b8-a5a2-414c-8a0e-40513e426c00) 

> There are opportunities in education in servicing the poor in the US and building a company in Asia — not in selling to the middle class in the US. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-com-92-un-0-w-0-n-4-xbnhqd-4-pvqi-9--18947c50359#3997782b-3e33-46c8-94eb-339e8a33c55e) 

> Interestingly, in the US, the people who are most willing to try new things are the poor and uneducated because they have a similar incentive structure to a person in rural India. Their default state is “screwed.” If a poor person doesn’t do something dramatic, they are going to stay screwed. Many parents and teachers in these communities understand this. So the communities are often willing to try new, experimental things — online education, charter schools, longer school days, no summer vacation, co-op programs — even if they may not work. Why? Because their students’ default state is “screwed” and they need something dramatically better. Doing something significantly higher quality is the only way to overcome the inertia of already being screwed. The affordable, but poor quality approaches just aren’t good enough. These communities are on the hunt for dramatically better approaches and willing to try new things. Unfortunately the poor don’t have a lot of money to spend so servicing this community requires selling to the schools, which is an enterprise sales type of business — not a consumer business.
