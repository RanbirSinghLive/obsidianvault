## Highlights

> The most validated core conclusion of social science across many decades and thousands of studies is that _human_ intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-why-ai-will-save-the-world-1894534a0e6#b43adcd8-e5a2-4ed3-948d-faba71d27fe4) 

> we have used our intelligence to raise our standard of living on the order of 10,000× over the last 4,000 years. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-why-ai-will-save-the-world-1894534a0e6#bd3ff218-ee62-4393-8699-88c733c1856a) 

> Economists have observed a [longstanding pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers%5Fand%5FBaptists) in reform movements of this kind. The actors within movements like these fall into two categories—Baptists and Bootleggers—drawing on the historical example of the [prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition%5Fin%5Fthe%5FUnited%5FStates):
> 
> * Baptists are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel—deeply and emotionally, if not rationally—that new restrictions, regulations, and laws are required to prevent societal disaster.  
> For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally [devout Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie%5FNation) who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks—strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it.
> * Bootleggers are the self-interested opportunists who stand to profit financially by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors.  
> For alcohol prohibition, these were the [literal bootleggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Bootleggers) who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned.
