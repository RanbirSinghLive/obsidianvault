## Highlights

> I recently discussed the TV series _Yellowstone_ with Richard Hanania. My impression is that it has echoes of _Sons of Anarchy_: A highly entertaining and hugely popular series with straightforward plots, low-to-medium depth characters, and the trappings of prestige television. I think that last part is why it confuses people. I recall Kurt Sutter (SOA creator) saying that his show was about a motorcycle gang, it’s not Shakespeare and it’s not _The Wire_. Just enjoy and don’t read too deeply into it.

> _Yellowstone_ is enjoyable whether you read too much into it or just completely shut your brain off. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/yellowstone-female-conversations-economic-crimes-18944684cb2#b708a633-0a1e-4a45-a35f-932b9b3c0177) 

> In mixed-sex social settings, once the group size exceeds four, they tend to split off into single-sex groups. Women in such settings frequently initiate all-female conversations, as they find the typical male conversational style too confrontational and disconcerting.
