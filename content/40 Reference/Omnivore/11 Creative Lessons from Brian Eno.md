## Highlights

> Eno says that [“art is everything you _don’t_ _have_ to do”](https://link.workweek.com/click/33415333.51487/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g%5Fdj1YSVZmd0RKLWtEayZ0PTg1N3MmaGFzaGVkX3VzZXI9MDkwZGQxNWYxYTExN2EwOWU4MDUyYTcwOWUzMjM4ZmU/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873Bfb5b08f7).
> 
> Here is a thought experiment to explain that quote.
> 
> Think of a screwdriver. Humans created the tool to serve the functional goal of constructing things (to keep peace in my marriage, I’ve outsourced a lot of “constructing things” to Task Rabbit).
> 
> That functional purpose is represented by the tip, which is identical across all screwdrivers for a specific screw or drill bit.
> 
> You _have to_ make the tip that way for it to work.
> 
> On the other hand, the screwdriver handle doesn't need to be exactly the same in terms of appearance, feel, or design. This is what makes the handle a form of "art". While comfort may be a factor, it ultimately comes down to a stylistic choice for your preferred handle.

> 
> This framework applies to any everyday object. Consider your coffee mug, car, clothes, desk chair, or laptop.
> 
> Each object has a necessary function, while everything else is considered "art." For example, a coffee mug obviously has to hold liquid, but the handle can have various designs that cater to different aesthetic preferences.

> **Software gives too many options**
> 
> Eno has no qualms about using technology for music production.
> 
> But he notes an interesting downside: technology removes constraints, which — as we discussed with the Windows 95 startup sound — is important for creativity.
> 
> [Per Eno](https://link.workweek.com/click/33415333.51487/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9KVUw4a05ZbWdzQT9zaT1jNlM4THZCeDlfMFVuYjkyJnQ9MTU4NCZoYXNoZWRfdXNlcj0wOTBkZDE1ZjFhMTE3YTA5ZTgwNTJhNzA5ZTMyMzhmZQ/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873D20626d83) (bold mine):
> 
> _"Doesn't it strike you as interesting that we are in the second decade of the 21st century and a lot of the most interesting music is still being made by people playing very primitive instruments like electric guitars and drums._
> 
> _I mean, what is a drum kit? It could be a bunch of old chairs or cans or anything. It's really quite an arbitrary bunch of junk, but why is it that people can still make interesting stuff?_
> 
> _Not only interesting but \[also\] innovative stuff using those tools, which — in digital terms — are hopelessly limited compared to all the fabulous possibilities of software synths and a program like Logic?_
> 
> **_Well, the reason is because it's hopelessly limited. The reason is that you very quickly can understand what you can do with an electric guitar or a violin or a set of drums and you stop looking for more options and you start grappling with it._**
> 
> _The problem with software-based work is that you never know what it does. You can never exhaust what it does. So you can always cover the fact that you haven't got an idea by trying another option. If you have a lot of options, you don't usually have a lot of rapport with the instrument. If you have a few options, your rapport keeps increasing because you understand the options better and better. And this is why people still make good music with crude instruments and simple instruments. Because they understand them better than our software."_ 
> 
> Eno shared this thought in 2013.
> 
> It holds even more true in the world of generative AI. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/11-creative-lessons-from-brian-eno-18be2321c12#6718aa8b-78b9-4911-affc-fe0b5e8d5cbc)

> He has over 2, 800 incomplete works himself.
> 
> One method that he has found to try and finish these pieces is to simply play them on random shuffle and “surrender” to a serendipitous moment of creative breakthrough (if it ever does arise).
> 
> Maybe a certain song is meant to be finished at a [specific time and place](https://link.workweek.com/click/33415333.51487/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9KVUw4a05ZbWdzQT9zaT1vbjBsbjJDWXFoZWdsYWd2JnQ9NDM5MSZoYXNoZWRfdXNlcj0wOTBkZDE1ZjFhMTE3YTA5ZTgwNTJhNzA5ZTMyMzhmZQ/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873E9f951dde): [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/11-creative-lessons-from-brian-eno-18be2321c12#0bc20f0f-b62e-4f90-ad35-542524e89aca)
