## Highlights

> Erik Hoel, an American neuroscientist, posits that the industries AI are disrupting are not all that lucrative. He coined the phrase “**supply paradox of AI**” — the notion that the easier it is to train AI to do something, the less economically valuable that thing is. 
> 
> “This is because AI performance scales based on its supply of data, that is, the quality and size of the training set itself,” said Hoel. “So when you are biased towards data sets that have an overwhelming supply, that, in turn, biases the AI to produce things that have little economic value.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-erikhoel-p-all-the-existential-risk--190e6a43922#3c5950ee-a410-4e27-ab01-ebe21576169c)
