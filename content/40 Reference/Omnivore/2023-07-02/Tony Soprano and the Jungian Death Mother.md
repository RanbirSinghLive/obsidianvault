## Highlights

> In a therapy session, Dr. Melfi traced the origins of Tony’s panic attacks to a dormant memory: as a child, Tony secretly witnessed his father chop off a guy’s finger for not paying off his gambling debts. Later, young Tony witnesses his father seduce his mother with the earnings he procured from that violent event. Tony learned that to be worthy of his mother’s love (or, perhaps, any woman’s love), he would have to become a man like his father. Tony has his first panic attack, collapsing in front of his parents. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tony-soprano-and-the-jungian-death-mother-18916116531#402ff9ec-90e0-4785-a974-6703bd29135f) 

> Tony receives more audience sympathy than just about any other antihero because we got to explore practically every inch of his psyche. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/tony-soprano-and-the-jungian-death-mother-18916116531#3580831a-dc99-49b5-81fe-fead7efb7f16)
