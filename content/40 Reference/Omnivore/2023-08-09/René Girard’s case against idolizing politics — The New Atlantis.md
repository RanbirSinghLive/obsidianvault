## Highlights

> ##### Culture War as Imitation Game 
> 
> Girard identified two kinds of mimetic models: external and internal. External models are those outside of our immediate world — for instance, celebrities (the Kardashians), historical figures (Rosa Parks), or fictional characters (Ted Lasso). Here, imitation can only go one way. A soccer coach can try to channel the “Ted Lasso Way,” but Ted Lasso will not be influenced by the coach. There is no possibility of reciprocal desires taking shape.
> 
> Internal models of desire are inside of our world, and so the imitation _can_ become reciprocal. There is the possibility of escalation. This, in my view, is the most dangerous thing that social media has done to our collective psyche and the reason why mimetic rivalry is so widespread today. Nearly overnight, the Internet put us all inside one another’s heads as internal models of desire — whether positively or negatively.

> Surveying American politics, Girard began to see a giant imitation machine. The arms race during the Cold War — two powers reflexively imitating each another in building nuclear weapons — unfolded outside the bounds of logic to the point of “mutually assured destruction,” with the countries signing occasional agreements to [manage their rivalry](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-russia-nuclear-arms-control) and prevent further mimetic escalation.
