## Highlights

> It’s about the current pain they’re trying to alleviate, the future pain they’re anticipating, the hypothetical pain they’re angling to avoid. Without that understanding, it is impossible to predict what they are about to do and predicting what people are about to do is the entirety of existing in a society. You avoid getting punched in the face by successfully predicting what words and actions won’t trigger that response.

> We have this idea that logic resides on a level above and beyond emotion, that the smarter you are, the more analytical, the better your ability to make the optimal decision. So, it’s the emotional child who tries to save the life of a sick baby bird but, in the process, contracts a lethal bird flu that spreads to the whole village. It’s the cold, logical, rational man who can do the dispassionate calculation to realize that allowing one bird to suffer and die is better than risking the spread of a disease to countless humans.
> 
> But I just used a word there that utterly obliterates the premise:
> 
> “Better.”
> 
> That is a concept that cannot be made via cold calculation. A universe boiled down to particles and numbers cannot care whether atoms arranged as a suffering plague victim are “better” than those arranged as a healthy child, or a plant, or a cloud of gas. It was actually the rational man’s _emotional attachment to his fellow humans_ that made him want to prevent the spread of the pathogen, the emotion of empathy that comes from having himself felt the pain of sickness, of having mourned a lost loved one, of having feared death. When we say he was being cold and logical, what we really mean is that he was able to more accurately gauge his emotions, to know that his feelings toward the village were stronger than his feelings toward the bird.
> 
> There is literally no such thing as logic without emotion, because even your choice to use logic was made based on the ethereal value judgment that it would lead to “better” outcomes for the society you feel an emotional attachment to. To fully disentangle emotion from a decision is to always arrive at the same conclusion: that nothing is ever worth doing.

> It kind of seems to me like the whole reason we’re building a superintelligence is that we’re hoping that _it can tell us._ That we will finally have a present, tangible entity whose directives cannot be questioned, to rescue us from the burden of asking what this is all for, so we can finally stop arguing about it. But if we successfully create such a being, I’m pretty sure that when we ask, “What is the purpose of humanity?” that it will have only one response:
> 
> “To maximize my pleasure and minimize my suffering.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-link-sbstck-com-redirect-40-a-2-ef-4-a-e-736-42-af-8-c-1-a-189d88aeae0#54aeb7e1-0d0d-413b-8f90-bba4cbae4d83)
