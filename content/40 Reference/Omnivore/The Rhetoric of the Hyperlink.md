## Highlights

> Consider these different non-hyperlinked ways of writing a sentence, within a hypothetical story set in Bollywood.
> 
> * Fishbowl/_Slumdog Millionaire_ method: Amitabh stared grimly from a tattered old _Sholay_ poster.
> * Expository: Amitabh Bachchan, the Bollywood superstar, stared grimly from a tattered old _Sholay_ poster. _Sholay,_ as everybody knew, was the blockbuster that truly established Bachchan.
> * Global contextual: Amitabh Bachchan, the Clint Eastwood of India, stared grimly down from a tattered old _Sholay_ poster. _Sholay,_ that odd mix of Kurosawa and John Wayne that drove India wild.
> * Salman Rushdie method: Amitabh, _he-of-boundless-splendor_, stared down, a-flaming, from a tattered old _Sholay_ poster.
> 
> Critics and authors alike agonize endlessly about the politics of these different voices. This particular example, crossing as it does linguistic and cultural boundaries, in the difficult domain of fiction, is extreme. But the same sorts of figure/ground/voice dynamics occur when you write in-culture or non-fiction.
> 
> The first simply ignores non-Indian readers, who must look in at Indians constructing meaning within a fishbowl, with no help. It is simple, but unless the intent is genuinely to write only for Indians (which is essentially impossible on the Web, in English), not acknowledging the global context is a significant decision (whether deliberate or unthinking).
> 
> The second method is simply technically bad. If you can’t solve the problem of exposition-overload, you shouldn’t be writing fiction.
> 
> The third method is the sort of thing that keeps literary scholars up at nights, worrying about themes of oppression. Is acknowledging Clint Eastwood as the prototypical strong-silent action hero a political act that legitimizes the cultural hegemony of the West? What if I’d said _Bruce Lee of India_ or _Toshiro Mifune of India?_ Would those sentences be acts of protest?
> 
> Rushdie pioneered the last method, the literary equivalent of theater forms where the actors acknowledge the audience and engage them in artistic ways. Rushdie finesses the problem by adopting neither simplicity nor exposition, but a deliberate, audience-aware self-exoticization-with-a-wink. If you know enough about India, you will recognize “he-of-boundless-splendor” as one literal meaning of the name Amitabh, while _Sholay_ means “flames.” By putting in cryptic (to outsiders) cultural references, Rushdie simultaneously establishes an identity for his voice, and demands of non-Indians that they either work to access constructible meaning, or live with opacity. At the same time, Indians are forced to look at the familiar within a disconcerting context.
> 
> But Rushdie’s solution is far from perfect. In Midnight’s Children, for instance, he translates _chand-ka-tukda_, an affectionate phrase for a child in Hindi, literally as _piece-of-the-moon._ A more idiomatically appropriate translation would be something like _sweetie-pie._ Depending on the connotations of “moon” in non-Indian languages, the constructed meaning could be anywhere from weird to random. That gets you into the whole business of talking about languages, local and global metaphors, translation, and the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2007/12/16/sapir-whorf-lakoff-metaphor-and-thought/). Fine if that rich tapestry of crap is what you want to write about. Not so good if you actually just want to write a story about a pampered child.
> 
> Here is a solution that was simply not available to writers in the past:
