## Highlights

> Altruism (as measured both by self-report and by amount of money donated in a game) predicted a larger number of sexual partners among men, even when controlling for narcissism and Big Five personality traits. Men who scored low on altruism (1 standard deviation below the mean) reported 4 lifetime sexual partners; men who scored high on altruism (1 standard deviation above the mean) reported 12 lifetime sexual partners. Interestingly, among women, altruism was not correlated with lifetime number of sexual partners. These findings are consistent with research on hunter-gatherer societies, which found that men who hunt and share meat tend to have more sexual partners and more children.
