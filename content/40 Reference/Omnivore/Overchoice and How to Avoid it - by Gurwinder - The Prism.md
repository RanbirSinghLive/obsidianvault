## Highlights

> the [10:10:10 strategy](https://nomadcapitalist.com/global-citizen/freedom/use-10-10-10-rule-make-best-decisions/): consider how a decision will affect you in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. This is particularly good for fighting addictions. For instance, if you’re on a diet but craving a chocolate muffin, consider how you’ll feel 10 minutes after consuming it, and you’ll realize you’ll no longer taste the chocolatiness, and will only feel guilt. Furthermore, in 10 months you’ll have no memory of ever having eaten it. By stepping outside the present moment, you become less vulnerable to the desire for immediate gratification.
