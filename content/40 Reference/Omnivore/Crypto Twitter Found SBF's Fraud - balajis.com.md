## Highlights

> So: yes, the only reason SBF was even _exposed_, let alone convicted was because of people posting on Twitter. Twitter is important! That’s why the regime didn’t want Trump to post on there, doesn’t want [you](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/opinion/sunday/free-speech-social-media-violence.html) to post on there, and doesn’t want Elon to _let_ you post on there. As far back as the [Arab Spring](https://www.washington.edu/news/2011/09/12/new-study-quantifies-use-of-social-media-in-arab-spring/), it was clear that Twitter could topple regimes. And in this case, it toppled the regime’s [#2 donor](https://archive.ph/Dnxv1), “one of the people who is among the[ most responsible](https://archive.ph/05ezK#selection-1663.37-1663.120) for \[Biden\] being in office.” Needless to say, this was _not_ an outcome any establishment figure sought before the events of Nov 2022.

> This truly cannot be emphasized enough: no legacy journalist, politician, regulator, or policeman caught Bankman-Fried’s fraud! Only the blockchain did. Up to the very end, SBF was saying that “[FTX is fine, assets are fine](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-removes-assets-are-fine-flood-from-twitter)”. But because of what the blockchain represents, millions of people around the world were able to _independently_ fact check him by testing their ability to withdraw and then viewing the results on chain. SBF could deceive a failed State, but he met his match in the decentralized Network. He couldn’t enable withdrawals because he wasn’t good for the money.

> _**In short: the Network succeeded where the State failed.**_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/crypto-twitter-found-sbf-s-fraud-balajis-com-18bb4bf3810#71a0bbc0-958d-4eed-bc43-a248aad5916b)
