## Highlights

> A short lesson about kindness and generosity: 
> 
> "I heard my mom asking our neighbor for some salt. We had salt at home so I asked her why she was asking. 
> 
> She told me, "They don't have much money and they sometimes ask us for things. So I asked for something small that wouldn't burden them. I want them to feel as if we needed them too. That way, it will be much easier for them to ask us for anything they need."
