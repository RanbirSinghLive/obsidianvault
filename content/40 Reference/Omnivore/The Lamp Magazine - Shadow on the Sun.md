## Highlights

> Once, not so long ago, old people who couldn’t work were either looked after by their families, or not at all—and that “not at all” was a very frightening prospect. A century ago, fifty-eight percent of American men over sixty-five still participated in the labor market: it was either that, or burden their children, or starve. This was not a very good state of affairs. But what we have now instead is deeply strange: mass consumer pensions have turned our entire adulthood into a preamble to old age. You work for three, four, five decades—all so you can enjoy those few, brief, useless years between retirement and death. Not just that: everyone in the world is now working to increase the value of your pension, even the coal miners in India and the garment-sewers in Brazil and all the other billions without any pensions of their own. The entire global economy is now a machine for producing satisfied retirees. Capitalism, which blundered about the world for four hundred years without any ends other than itself, has now found its purpose.
