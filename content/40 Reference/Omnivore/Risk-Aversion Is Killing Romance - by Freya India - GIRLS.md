## Highlights

> There are reasons for our risk-aversion. Jonathan Haidt is [right](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/anglo-teen-suicide) when he talks about the sudden switch from play-based to phone-based childhoods and how it destroyed mental health—[particularly](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls?utm%5Fsource=substack&utm%5Fmedium=email) for young girls. Our childhoods weren’t spent toying with risk and danger, teaching ourselves we could cope with it, learning that it’s baked into life. We had bans on play fighting. Health and safety obsessions. Rules and regulations. Simulations of play on screens. It was hammered into us that the ultimate goal in life is comfort and safety, and anything that comes with risk is a threat. It’s hard to rewire that. 
> 
> Then, of course, there’s social media, dating apps—these mechanical ways we meet and find love. Fake spaces where we can avoid any form of discomfort. Where we swipe through people like products instead of approaching them with a pounding heart; where we ghost and block instead of learning how to have difficult conversations; where we start relationships without real risk, without intense chemistry, with no feeling at all. Now we get together not from passion or thrill but after analysing profiles, reviewing selfies, rehearsing DMs. It’s all so _safe_;it’s all so calculated.
