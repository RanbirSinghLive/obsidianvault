## Highlights

> The zeitgeist author is Sally Rooney, the bard of disappointment, who resonates in an era of graduates living four to a house as they cross 30. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-archive-li-z-hd-5-r-18bf3cea3fb#e6020b84-84ad-46ff-a087-5136da676f11) 

> Forced to say what is difficult about middle age, I wouldn’t cite the slackening of the skin or the retiring of once beloved clothes or even the creeping awareness of death. It is the lack of something to hustle towards. I’ll keep inveigling myself into ever higher gradations of the urban upper-middle. I might perform a great leap of hypergamy. But the will is only half-there. I have got most of what I wanted. Sophisticated ennui, I can tell novelists and screenwriters, isn’t where the drama of life is. I was poorer, gaucher, worse-read, less confident and much, much more alive at 23 than I am now, a stalwart Pol-lover but more of a Taittinger man.
