## Highlights

> Eighteen months after Gullaba self-published, Bernard Schweizer, a former English professor, launched a brand-new publishing house in January 2023\. Called [Heresy Press](https://heresy-press.com/mission/), Schweizer gave it a mission statement of embracing “freedom, honesty, openness, dissent, and real diversity in all of its manifestations. . . . We discourage authors from descending into self-censorship, we don’t blink at alleged acts of cultural appropriation, and we won’t pander to the presumed sensitivities of hypothetical readers.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-e-969-f-810-d-20-a-41-a-3-8-ba-3-2-c-18c5bc08459#bce91b9d-c8e9-4e1d-9a27-d514a104346d)
