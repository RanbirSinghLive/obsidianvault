## Highlights

> **Zipf’s Law (linguistics)**: There is a heavy power law distribution in the words people use, with the most common word (“the”) being used twice as often as the second-most-common word (“of”), which is used twice as often as the third-most-common word, (“and”), etc. There are something like 180,000 English words, but fewer than 200 make up half of the words people speak and write. So even in a massively diversified set, a tiny handful of things make up the majority of occurrences. It’s the same in business and investing – [tails drive everything](https://collabfund.com/blog/tails-you-win/), and it’s easy to underestimate how important just a few companies, a few investing periods, and a few products are to your long-term success. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-one-big-web-a-few-ways-the-world-works-187c093dc71#2280a9cd-afa0-4872-a31d-8c8f7cdfc536) 

> **Gause’s principle (evolution)**: Two species that coexist and compete for limited resources cannot continue at constant populations – one will eventually push the other into extinction or weakness. It’s the same in business: Without some sort of differentiating edge, companies that directly compete against one another often resemble a death match. I like Naval’s point on this topic: “Escape competition through authenticity … Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-one-big-web-a-few-ways-the-world-works-187c093dc71#bafde159-6887-4aa7-9727-6c1c506609d3)
