## Highlights

> Twenty years ago, Peter Attia was working as a trainee surgeon at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, where he saved countless people facing what he calls “fast death”. “I trained in a very, very violent city,” he tells me. “We were probably averaging 15 or 16 people a day getting shot or stabbed. And, you know, that’s when surgeons can save your life. We’re really good at that.”
> 
> What got to him, he says, were the people he treated who were in the midst of dying much more slowly. “All the people with cardiovascular disease, all the people with cancer: we were far less effective at saving those people. We could delay death a little bit, but we weren’t bending the arc of their lives.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-theguardian-com-lifeandstyle-2023-mar-28-healthspan-re-187bf61e945#0b00606c-50d7-49c6-8eb0-512b7d0f0ed6) 

Dying Fast & Slow

> Attia is not selling “biological reprogramming technology” – the kind of [emerging science](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/02/could-we-make-ageing-a-thing-of-the-past) that aims at extending life via such techniques as flushing out worn (or “senescent”) cells from the body, or inserting genes into adult cells that convert them into stem cells. In the US, this is attracting no end of private funding, from such enthusiasts as the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the tech investor Peter Thiel, who claims to be planning to live to 120\. While Attia is “involved with scientists who are doing that type of work”, he says, “it’s amazing to me how many people that I encounter choose to live a relatively unhealthy life today in the belief that that will be their salvation.”

> He has really met people like that? “Oh my God: spend more time in Silicon Valley. You know, it’s like these people are spending all of this time and money on these endeavours, and yet they’re not exercising. They’re not sleeping well, and they’re not taking care of their stress, and all these other things that are killing them anyway. But they have this belief: ‘Well, it’s OK, because this thing is going to rescue me.’ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-theguardian-com-lifeandstyle-2023-mar-28-healthspan-re-187bf61e945#c483a29a-3a98-4723-8a3d-355358641926) 

Procrastination of the objectively right thing isn’t solely the realm of the poor.

> “It really makes sense when you consider what an evolutionary sacrifice it was for us to sleep. Think about evolution, and how ruthless it is in optimising your ability to procreate, forage for food and protect yourself – three things you can’t do when you’re sleeping. And yet, somehow, we didn’t out-evolve a way to spend eight hours in an unconscious state. It’s a very compelling evolutionary argument for why this thing must matter.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-theguardian-com-lifeandstyle-2023-mar-28-healthspan-re-187bf61e945#344ddce1-0797-49bf-9a01-c0c1ad3b647e)
