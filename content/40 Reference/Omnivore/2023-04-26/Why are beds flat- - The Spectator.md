## Highlights

> You are also faced with another problem: domestic products typically have to be sold to two people, of whom one is usually more Luddite. I come from south Wales; my wife, unfortunately, from Sussex, where they have a thing called ‘taste’. This means she prefers to spend money and time making hair-splitting distinctions between shades of Farrow &amp; Ball rather than simply buying a 75” flatscreen TV so you no longer have to look at your walls for entertainment.
