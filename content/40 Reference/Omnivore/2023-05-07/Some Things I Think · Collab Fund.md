## Highlights

> Social media makes more sense when you view it as a place people go to perform rather than a place to communicate. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-thoughts-187c09319e8#213178d5-ea5a-452b-b8b7-7bd0e077b6d0) 

> Logic doesn’t persuade people. Clarity, storytelling, and appealing to self-interest do. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-thoughts-187c09319e8#ab2f3c9b-129e-4d4f-af1d-82364ddd5605) 

> The most important decision most people will ever make is whether, when, and whom to marry. But that topic is never taught in school. It can’t be – everyone’s different, and you can’t reduce it to a formula or a statistic. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-thoughts-187c09319e8#9002a2ef-d85f-4d37-bf85-85608435e84a) 

> Many people check their portfolios every day but their blood pressure every few years, if even that. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-thoughts-187c09319e8#ed0e560d-5168-417b-a6f0-6613b4a5fa8b) 

> In school they tell you your paper must be a minimum of five pages long. In the real world you have five seconds to catch someone’s attention before they’re bored and move on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-thoughts-187c09319e8#7373a25c-d257-4bb6-a40b-ef5cd1aadce9) 

> Every generation is disappointed in their kids, partly because things typically get better over time, and you become resentful as you see younger generations bypassing problems you had to overcome.
