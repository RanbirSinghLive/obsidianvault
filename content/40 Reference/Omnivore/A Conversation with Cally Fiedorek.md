## Highlights

> You can't write from the outside in, from the elevator pitch or jacket copy. You can try, of course, but the work will be self-conscious, schematic, performative, inert—no good. You’ve got to find the human register, the single voice or personality, and then work your way outward. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-conversation-with-cally-fiedorek-18fcea48046#96729c32-07bc-4397-a3d9-f570d3e2274e) 

> Writing a debut novel is more like—to use a slightly gross and unappealing metaphor—emptying the vacuum filter, seeing what's been stuck in there, what faces and places and images and conversations have been sticking around in your craw the last couple decades, what the best, least boring, most showmanly way is to connect and externalize those things for a reader.
