## Highlights

> **Work** **habits**: I have a laser focus that enables me to dissect a 15-page white paper the same way I approach a 350-page novel. Some projects, like some novels, take three, four, sometimes five years between kick-off and pay-off (my new book, [_This Could Hurt_](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062660763/this-could-hurt), took seven), so I’ve learned patience and persistence: chipping away, day in and day out, and setting small milestones to mark my progress.
