# Jim Simons: The GOAT Investor
#Omnivore

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/jim-simons-the-goat-investor-18f8b34ccc8)
[Read Original](https://www.readtrung.com/p/jim-simons-and-the-making-of-renaissance?hashed_user=090dd15f1a117a09e8052a709e3238fe)

## Highlights

> Interestingly, the fund only won 50.75% of its trades. An army of top PhDs are basically a coin flip in trading. Markets are hard AF (most should just buy and hold).
> 
> Mercer has perhaps the most quotable quote of the entire Renaissance Technologies story: “We’re right 50.75% of the time, but we’re 100% right 50.75% of the time. You can make billions that way.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/jim-simons-the-goat-investor-18f8b34ccc8#6fe0c6ea-af07-4132-9a13-cfe0037a5834)
