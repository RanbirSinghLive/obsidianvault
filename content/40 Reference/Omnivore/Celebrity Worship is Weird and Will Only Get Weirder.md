## Highlights

> Well, it’s the same for an author; when content is infinite, only personality stands out. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-9-db-82-e-4-e-2-a-36-41-b-8-a-46-c-9-18bdf75bd3e#2d8db38f-7cd9-4d29-a37a-1880a06574c7) 

> I literally cannot write novels as a full time job unless I turn myself into a multimedia influencer that posts daily to a large, loyal, highly-engaged audience. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-9-db-82-e-4-e-2-a-36-41-b-8-a-46-c-9-18bdf75bd3e#497ec4a9-8549-4a3e-bf8e-ce1ddbe6030d) 

> In the course of promoting this upcoming book, I will appear on at least twenty episodes of other people’s podcasts and will be interviewed by some print publications. In those appearances, I won’t be selling the new novel’s premise or characters—those things are a dime a dozen, AI can generate them in a microsecond. I’ll instead be selling its author as an Amazing Guy Whose Ideas Are Fascinating And Whose Fandom You Want To Be A Part Of. The system is telling me that I have to make it so that my name on the cover has the same hypnotic effect as an Apple logo_._ I find this all utterly surreal.

> The rest of my writing career doesn’t rest in my ability to generate story ideas or execute them—plenty of incredible novels sell fewer than a hundred lifetime copies—but in doing that extremely well _and also_ making my personality and lifestyle interesting to the masses. I must become something other than a person, a symbol that can act as a receptacle for strangers’ excess emotions, including their random, ravenous hatred.
