## Highlights

> * **When love and attentive care are available, kids don’t necessarily know they’re living in poverty.**
> 
> When he was a baby, Sowell’s parents gave him to be raised by his elderly aunt (“more like my grandmother than my mother”) and her adult daughters, Birdie and Ruth. Sowell’s mother later observed that he had a better material life with his aunt than she could ever give him. Sowell’s father was ill, and they already had four children to care for. Raised by his aunt, Sowell describes how as a child, he was “loved, and perhaps even spoiled.” 
> 
> As a young boy, Sowell, along with his aunt and her adult children, lived in a wooden house in North Carolina without electricity, central heating, or hot running water.
> 
> Despite this, Sowell writes, “It never occurred to me that we were living in poverty, and in fact these were some of the happiest times of my life…Once I tagged along with Ruth when she went to her job as a maid in the home of some white people. When I saw two faucets in their kitchen, I was baffled and said: ‘They sure must drink a lot of water around here.’” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lessons-i-learned-from-thomas-sowell-s-memoir-1895e28944b#8c93fc8d-35cb-4581-97d6-44188b1db744) 

> * **Trust people who value being honest more than being nice.**
> 
> As the Korean War intensified, Sowell was drafted into the Marine Corps. He notes that color did not matter, as all new recruits were treated with equal disdain. Sowell describes his life in the Marine barracks in Pensacola. There were two non-commissioned officers permanently stationed to oversee the young marines. One was Sergeant Gordon, “a genial, wisecracking guy who took a somewhat relaxed view of life.” The other was Sergeant Pachuki, “a disciplinarian who spoke in a cutting and ominous way” and was always “impeccably dressed.” 
> 
> Sowell and his peers preferred Sergeant Gordon, as he was more easygoing. Sowell had to go into town to pick up a package. Sowell asked his Chief Petty Officer if he could leave the base to retrieve his package. Sowell received permission.
> 
> Later, while Sowell was not on base, he was marked as absent and was accused of being AWOL (absent without leave), a serious offense. Sowell knew Sergeant Gordon, the nice one, had overheard him asking for permission to leave the base. Gordon denied having heard anything, and told Sowell, “You’re just going to have to take your punishment like a man.” Gordon fretted that if he crossed the higher-ups, he would be reassigned to fight in Korea.
> 
> But unasked, Sergeant Pachuki came forward and spoke with the colonel, explaining the situation. As a result, Sowell was exonerated and returned back to his duties.
> 
> Referring to Gordon, the “nice” sergeant who betrayed him, Sowell writes, “People who are everybody’s friend usually means they are nobody’s friend.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lessons-i-learned-from-thomas-sowell-s-memoir-1895e28944b#0909133f-2489-49f5-8f77-caf5964af65d)
