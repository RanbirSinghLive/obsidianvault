## Highlights

> Across all these dozens of cases, Moss finds common themes. The need for secrecy around a project in its early stages (novelist Michael Cunningham: “There’s no surer way that I know to lose faith than by summing it up too soon. ‘It’s about a guy, a whale bit off his leg, he’s really mad.’”) The near-certainty that your original plan won’t survive. (Cunningham again: “It took me a while to realize that if a novel is any good, it’s going to defeat what little idea that took you into it in the first place. It’s going to become something else, and your experience of that as a writer is, _Oh it’s just not working out_.”) The self-loathing that ensues. (Sofia Coppola: “Everyone feels like their stuff is awful.”) The utility of assets that don’t feel creative at all: a deadline, a dare, technique and muscle memory built up from a lifetime of making things.
