## Highlights

> In fact, my host told me, even though spectacular mountains dot the landscape, and farms were seldom far from a thrilling climb, farmers might never hike up the rocky slopes to enjoy the gobsmacking views. (I can confirm that Iceland is as astonishing as you imagine. And then some.) This isn’t ancient Viking history, please note. Within living memory, farmers might _go their whole lives_ without ever climbing the mountains they saw every day — because burning thousands of calories to climb a mountain for no reason other than the pleasure of exercise and glorious vistas is a luxury only the very rich can afford. 
> 
> But today, Icelanders are very rich. So they climb mountains. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-open-substack-com-pub-dgardner-p-wastelands-and-progress-r-18ffd114c8c#507a5fcb-da07-4dc2-b7f4-2586df3a8e55) 

> Beaches were wastelands through most of human history. There was often little food or other resources to be had on beaches. And they were dangerous. As places where boats could be launched or landed, people living near a beach were at risk of ocean-going pirates and slavers. Beaches were horrible places. 
> 
> There were exceptions, of course. Very rich Romans built villas on or near beaches at the heart of the Empire. But that sort of thing was extremely rare. Throughout most of human history, beaches were avoided.
