## Highlights

> The early web debates around this became known as  – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.

> Gardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-maggieappleton-com-garden-history-189f7356a57#ba76d67f-9dcd-4a26-b8db-1577fa202f7c) 

> Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined.

In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.
