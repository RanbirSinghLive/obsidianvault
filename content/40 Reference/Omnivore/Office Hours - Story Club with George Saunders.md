## Highlights

> this is the dream: to make something that, at first, the conventional mind of the culture doesn’t understand as “a story” but that, somehow (because of the way its shape and meaning intersects with our collective lived experience) comes to seem, in time, like “a story,” indeed.
> 
> Then we’re not “failing to write a real story” but “writing a truly original story, that has changed our expectation of the form.”
> 
> And wouldn’t that be fun? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/office-hours-story-club-with-george-saunders-18a7144cb41#27850809-6eb9-4fcc-8094-176b7af915ac)
