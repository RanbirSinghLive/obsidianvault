## Highlights

> This freeze response is well-documented in other disasters. The passengers whose plane crashed on the runway and stayed strapped into their seats, reassuring each other everything would be fine before they burned to death. The workers in the south tower who returned calmly to their offices on September 11th and watched with their own eyes as flames poured from the huge gaping hole punched in the building across from them.
> 
> Everything about these situations should have screamed run. But in their novelty and sudden out-of-context appearance, some people found it impossible to readjust their ideas about the future. **Cognitively, they found it easier to fall back on an old mental model of the world and their experience of that world than adjust the model in the face of immediate, observable realities.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-donotpanic-substack-com-p-staring-at-the-tsunami-18a50a5e152#d893b23f-535d-43ff-8155-472db93f2ad0) 

> **They concluded that “the human propensity toward optimism is facilitated by the brain's failure to code errors in estimation when those call for pessimistic updates. This failure results in selective updating, which supports unrealistic optimism that is resistant to change.”**
> 
> We are wired to ignore the apocalypse. 
> 
> But the experiment also revealed something else. It revealed that some people _did_ code for errors in estimation. One group of people did have the ability to over-ride innate optimism and accurately calculate risk - the clinically depressed**.**
> 
> At this point you might feel seen. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-donotpanic-substack-com-p-staring-at-the-tsunami-18a50a5e152#29e1b9c5-8f2b-408b-a565-c3b72b4d7797) 

> _“The pandemic is over, we’re making progress on climate change.”_ 
> 
> We are being prevented from accurately assessing risk by elites who are gaming a cognitive glitch to keep business-as-usual on the tracks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-donotpanic-substack-com-p-staring-at-the-tsunami-18a50a5e152#4a994065-0431-49aa-9820-b2b590a97e2e) 

> We can see the wave approaching, we’re trying to raise the alarm. 
> 
> We want to explain that if we appear sad sometimes, it’s because we’re accurately coding for risk. 
> 
> We want to share what we know. 
> 
> But the Panglossians won’t listen. They think they’ll surf the wave. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-donotpanic-substack-com-p-staring-at-the-tsunami-18a50a5e152#fbe1f8b6-da26-4b47-a418-8598d6253e9a)
