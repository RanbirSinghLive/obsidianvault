## Highlights

> We can’t have everything good all at once. We can have some good things, but we can’t have all good things at the same time.
> 
> Equally desirable ends often collide. Equally valued aims regularly contradict each other. 
> 
> Many smart people believe that all good things can be made to conspire towards a final harmonious resolution. Freedom is good. Happiness is good. Naturally, we think (or hope) that these and all other values naturally go together. But they don’t. 
> 
> The British philosopher Isaiah Berlin repeatedly stressed this point:
> 
> > _“The optimistic view…that all good things must be compatible, and that therefore freedom, order, knowledge, happiness…must be at least compatible, and perhaps even entail one another in a systematic fashion…is not self-evidently true…Indeed, it is perhaps one of the least plausible beliefs ever entertained by profound and influential thinkers.”_
> 
> Life is full of tradeoffs. Equally good and desirable things cannot be harmonized. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-paradox-of-liberation-18aa299b418#e0b2be3b-dde1-479e-8049-946abe93e99e)

> From a long [article](https://substack.com/redirect/4e080099-dea0-42d6-b3a9-d65dd580b184?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) about changes in family structure in _The Atlantic_:
> 
> > _“If you want to summarize the changes in family structure over the past century, the truest thing to say is this: We’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families. We’ve made life better for adults but worse for children.”_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-paradox-of-liberation-18aa299b418#9c61e259-15f6-4aa1-bd2f-3bac8a88cc21) 

> We sacrificed the happiness of children for the freedom of adults. And because every adult starts out as a child and carries their experiences with them, we get to live with the consequences.
