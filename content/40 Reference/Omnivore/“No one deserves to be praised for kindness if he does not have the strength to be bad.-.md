## Highlights

> “Praise is a clever, hidden, subtle form of flattery, which gratifies the giver and the recipient in different ways. The latter accepts it as a reward for his merit; the former bestows it to draw attention to his fair-mindedness and perceptiveness.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/no-one-deserves-to-be-praised-for-kindness-if-he-does-not-have-t-18b32ca5316#eb6d61bc-bb54-4a29-bb2a-fe22bec74876) 

> _“A refusal of praise is a desire to be praised twice over.”_
> 
> If someone delivers a compliment, the best thing you can do is say you appreciate it or quickly thank them and move on.  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/no-one-deserves-to-be-praised-for-kindness-if-he-does-not-have-t-18b32ca5316#681a5b10-88b5-4d06-8207-154927f7fcfc) 

> a quote from Donald Kingsbury: “Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/no-one-deserves-to-be-praised-for-kindness-if-he-does-not-have-t-18b32ca5316#40670044-65db-4e95-a3f2-b004446d1650) 

> Thus, even though the hypocritical behavior is dishonest, it inadvertently affirms the value system it seeks to sidestep.
> 
> In HBO miniseries _The Pacific_, based on a true account of 3 Marines in the Pacific theater during WWII, there is a scene in which one Marine (nicknamed “Snafu”) stops his friend (Sledge) from digging the gold teeth out of a dead Japanese soldier’s mouth. Interestingly, though, Sledge actually learned this trick from Snafu, who is more blasé about the brutality of war. So when Snafu stops him, he is a hypocrite. But the implication is that Snafu doesn’t want his friend to become like himself—he sees Sledge as a better man and doesn’t want him to reduce himself to such a repugnant act.

> In another example, a friend of mine who was sentenced to San Quentin State Prison when he was 21 later explained to me that many older prisoners (most of whom are tattooed) try to talk new inmates out of getting prison tattoos, and that prison tattooists often refuse to be the first one to tattoo a new inmate because they think a prison tattoo will ruin the young inmate’s future.
