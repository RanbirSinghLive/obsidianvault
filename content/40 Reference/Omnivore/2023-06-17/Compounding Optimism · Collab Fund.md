## Highlights

> Visa Founder Dee Hock says, “A book is far more than what the author wrote; it is everything you can imagine and read into it as well.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/compounding-optimism-collab-fund-188ca13e879#27987f79-50ef-4574-bcdb-e0f7815b81ce) 

> A trivial thing can grow into a massive thing, and faster than most people realize. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/compounding-optimism-collab-fund-188ca13e879#e0603420-cf47-4fc9-a45e-c55d7ddba7e3) 

> I’m not interested in the debate about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups. It’s completely irrelevant. What’s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas, and how well they’re cooperating, not how clever the individuals are. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/compounding-optimism-collab-fund-188ca13e879#373fed40-40c0-4b7a-a9f6-1546554b7e52) 

> Small ideas mixing and compounding into big ones – that’s what really drives the world. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/compounding-optimism-collab-fund-188ca13e879#6f5c8dca-3f3f-422f-b954-4de6d36dcfea)
