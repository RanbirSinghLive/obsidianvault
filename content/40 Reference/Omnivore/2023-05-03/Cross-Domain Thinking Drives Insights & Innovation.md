## Highlights

> The [idea behind Velcro](https://invention.si.edu/george-de-mestral-velcro-inventor) came during a walk inventor George De Mestral took with his dog. Noting how cockleburs stuck so stubbornly to his dog and his own clothes, he examined them under a microscope and saw they had many hooks. The hooks were what made the cockleburs doggedly attach to objects. Inspired by this little part of nature, De Mestral invented Velcro as a means of fastening material together.

> a McKinsey analysis of attitudes and skills you will need going forward:
> 
> 1. **AI will not replace all cognitive jobs, but it will substantially change many of them.**  
> Given what AI tools like ChatGPT and others can do this is going to happen. It will just impact different professions at different rates. Those most impacted will be jobs where generative AI is growing; creative jobs in journalism, ad agencies, design firms; the video and music industries; and IT, medicine and law. AI tools will replace some of the work done, either within those organizations or by consumers outside those companies performing the work themselves (e.g., creating their own images and logos for personal use).
> 2. **You won’t be replaced by AI. You will be replaced by a person with AI skills.**  
> The more than AI tools can be used to be productive in your job, the more this will be true for you. People who are fluent in generative and other types of AI will be able to get more done, be more creative, and learn faster than their counterparts who cannot. It behooves you to become proficient in these tools. [Some interesting examples](https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&amp;sa=t&amp;url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-making-these-jobs-easier-2023-2&amp;ct=ga&amp;cd=CAEYAioUMTU2MDY5MjU0MTcyNzM1NDc3NDUyGjY5MzliOGI5NjFlNTUyOGE6Y29tOmVuOlVT&amp;usg=AOvVaw2H-7hE0jJxZmJk-GoggKHx) of how some professionals are using ChatGPT to be more productive include real estate agents using it to create listings, marketers using it to create video scripts, a designer using it to create a branding guide and a teacher using it to better serve students.
> 3. **AI will eliminate some jobs in specific professions.**  
> At this point it is too early in the evolution of generative AI to say but it would seem logical that it will replace some percent of jobs in the specific professions mentioned above in #1.
> 4. **AI will create new jobs.**  
> It is unclear how many new jobs generative AI will create, however, we are seeing some already appear, mostly around the ability to write good prompts for the AI. We are seeing this especially for ChatGPT text entry to text output and tools like DALL-E which is text entry to image output. For example, [BuzzFeed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-to-use-chatgpt-creator-openai-to-help-create-some-of-its-content-11674752660) is asking its employees to use ChatGPT to “write inspired prompts” to create content while [a market has been created](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/2/23326868/dalle-midjourney-ai-promptbase-prompt-market-sales-artist-interview) for people who can write prompts that create the highest quality generated artwork.
