## Highlights

> I worry that some of the best writers of our generation are stuck making tweets and newsletters. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-4-com-38-umdxkpl-3-bkhogl-0-oearh-5--18ea0a2da4f#c66e876d-0822-4786-ab8a-0d91f1e2b70d) 

> And what about tweets? Are there any threads that rise to the level of books? 
> 
> Certainly, there are some. But even the great ones suffer from the ephemerality of the platforms.

> The longer-form of writing you focus on, the slower you’ll see results. But the more durable those results will be. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-click-convertkit-mail-4-com-38-umdxkpl-3-bkhogl-0-oearh-5--18ea0a2da4f#6049d506-065e-4983-8236-60763f826ece)
