## Highlights

> * A Reddit user posted a [great story](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37102442) on how he went from $0->$100m->$0 in 5 years.
> * “I was told to hire a lot of people. Put fuel on the fire they said. Bring industry experts who can move the needle. All this BS you hear all day. All failed. I hired VPs and bloated my payroll. Ultimately I ended up with a bunch of highly paid employees who don’t know how to do anything but to “build and lead amazing teams.” Imagine you hire someone to scale an area and their solution is to divide that area into 5 sub areas and hire someone for each of them to figure it out, etc. that’s their solution.”
> * "I ended up focusing my efforts on hiring and ramping up those VPs and dealing with their dumb ideas instead of focusing on my 3 core tenants: build, sell, and deliver."
> * The made sense.  
> They smelled good.  
> They made great leadership stories.  
> ...but none of it actually mattered to the customer.”
> * Very easy to get distracted by the dozens of things people tell you to focus on instead of just the boring fundamentals: **build, sell, and deliver.** [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/copilot-for-cooperations-futility-of-so-ps-0-100-m-0-in-5-years--189f4871bf0#a0ba8f0d-69e6-4ef8-9a57-880344ded6df)
