## Highlights

> The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#a91ca9c7-ce29-43d2-9c2b-19abfe9166ff) 

> What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.
> 
> Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.
> 
> The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted. \[[2](#f2n)\] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#488dfa34-b07c-466c-a96d-c627fb107151) 

> If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.\[[3](#f3n)\]
> 
> Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#be53d9b6-ae9b-47bb-bf08-8bb06d385c88) 

> When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become _increasingly_ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.
> 
> Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#73f4085c-036c-4363-ae4d-c5d9ee1e2638) 

> Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.\[[6](#f6n)\] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#8e3b6102-007e-41ce-b602-81009d283a4b) 

> we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#a35f6bb3-7fb9-4856-b9a3-58ceb9bb2ff8) 

> Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#01d2ef0b-32d3-4b82-a318-dd6da78e311c) 

> What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#b3383b7a-8b91-4db9-a01b-cce7f33204cf) 

> If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#dbcebcd2-ad37-4a58-b836-d5943e73b04e) 

> Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#5e98dd4c-386f-45c1-b995-740d307bb4dc) 

> Great ideas have to be true and new. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#01b01f7c-dea3-4eb7-a5c0-dbffd68d5a7b) 

> One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#56cb1442-979f-4b6b-b3e4-ab6e9168b1a8) 

> Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.\[[15](#f15n)\] [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#3b2a78ad-f1d3-4cf7-91aa-b1ec68c53cf2) 

> Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#ba6f9b4f-dba2-411d-aadb-2b7dbc16ab01) 

> Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#538104d7-f7a0-492c-80b0-39969af4d600) 

> The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#ad3a17e3-5f8a-42a5-930a-b57ce18bd495) 

> Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.
> 
> How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.
> 
> It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#c6c6b095-98d0-4988-bffa-e7c79510f6d2) 

> Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#0d839127-49ac-4e0e-b407-051f459f3738) 

> The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#b6dd35d7-f1f4-470c-b624-b6263d4b1bc1) 

> Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#3016f62a-c501-4f45-9087-5483cd0c3500) 

> Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#7dc284ee-db1b-4005-a7e1-6aaae55fa544) 

> Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#89d44ed5-6b02-4362-a3db-406821cd56cf) 

> And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#a867886c-a0f1-43ca-ab99-13b24c110d17) 

> I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-844506-f-7-51-b-7-4478-bc-71-cc-0241-1895938c254#d7d38705-5bdc-43c6-afc3-51e92124406a)
