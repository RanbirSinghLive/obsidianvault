## Highlights

> Every time I consider opening up a colony simulator like [Rimworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), or an ARPG like [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), or even a survival horror game like [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), I realize that the part of those games I really enjoy are inventory management and tweaking automations.
> 
> To be honest, it’s the same part of my brain that enjoys moving information around in my notes, or fiddling with my templates to optimize them. The sense of enjoyment and satisfaction I get from clearing out the guild stash in Path of Exile or doing all the quests in Rimworld is the same part of my brain that enjoys clearing out all of my tags.
