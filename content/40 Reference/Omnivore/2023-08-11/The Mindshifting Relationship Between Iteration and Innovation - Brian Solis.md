## Highlights

> “The audience comes last,” Rubin shares with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes.
> 
> Cooper’s response is reflective of what most are thinking in that moment, “What!? How could that be!?”
> 
> “The audience doesn’t know what they want,” he explains.
> 
> And here’s where it hits different.
> 
> “The audience only knows what’s come before,” he points out.
