## Highlights

> the brain is commonly regarded as a thinking machine, but it’s more often the opposite: a machine that tries to circumvent thinking. This is because thinking is extremely costly in time and calories, which in our evolutionary history were scant resources.
> 
> As such, the brain evolved to be a “cognitive miser” that operates according to the [principle of least effort](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1113/1/012007/pdf), taking shortcuts in thinking and perceiving that build a workable but hugely simplified (and cost effective) model of the world.

> In 2016 a team of physicists led by Lachlan Gunn investigated the accuracy of witnesses picking suspects from police lineups. They found that as the size of unanimous agreement increased, so did its inaccuracy, until it was no better than chance. The researchers discovered a simple statistical explanation for this “[paradox of unanimit](https://phys.org/news/2016-01-evidence-bad.html)y:” since everyone’s different, the probability of every single person happening to agree on one belief is tiny unless some irrational force, such as laziness or social pressure, is making them agree. In other words, the more people agree, the less likely they are thinking for themselves.

> Consensus leads to truth when the consensus-makers are motivated to reach truth. But public unanimity is as often a product of laziness, peer pressure, money, and ideology as of rational agreement, so the conformist often takes a shortcut not to truth but merely to the narratives that are most socially, politically, or financially convenient for the consensus-makers to have us believe.

> Contrarians will often justify their rejection of mainstream consensus by bringing up past examples of it being wrong. But they’ll never apply this same standard to the fringes, which have been wrong far more often. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-gurwinder-substack-com-p-why-you-are-probably-an-npc-18a38016fd5#cb21b0e9-0269-4328-8132-2b4cc1f1f101) 

> A time-tested finding is the [two-step flow theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/two-step-flow-of-communication), which states that most people's opinions are copied from their favorite “opinion leaders” (influencers, celebrities, demagogues), who in turn copy the opinions of their favored mass media. As such, a disciple’s idol is often themselves an NPC who is outsourcing his thinking to _Fox News_ or some other low-grade source.
> 
> This is especially true of opinion leaders who lead busy lives, such as Trump, Elon, and Tate, who couldn’t possibly have the time to adequately research and consider all the topics they confidently opine on. This is apparent in their many ignorant statements, such as Elon’s [claim](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240754657263144960?lang=en) that the US would be Covid-free by the end of April 2020, or his [promotion](https://news.sky.com/story/elon-musk-tweets-then-deletes-link-to-article-with-unfounded-theory-about-paul-pelosi-attack-12734753) of a bizarre conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi’s husband.

> Averagers understand that both leftists and rightists are partisans who prioritize tribe over truth. They know that the truth is often to be found between the extremes, so they take the most moderate, centrist view on all matters.

> Trying to form an opinion on everything leaves them no time to have an informed opinion on anything. 
> 
> The solution is to divide issues into tertiary, secondary, and primary.
> 
> Tertiary issues are those you don’t need to care about: the overwhelming majority of things. Consider what difference it will make whether or not you know something, and if it won’t make a difference, resolve to not have an opinion on that thing. Don’t even take a shortcut to beliefs about it. Just accept that you don’t know.
> 
> Secondary issues are things that interest you, but which you don’t need to get exactly right. On these issues you must take shortcuts, so take the best shortcut there is: adversarial learning. Seek out the best advocates of each side, and believe whoever is most convincing. If that’s too much work, get your news from websites like [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news) or [Ground News](https://ground.news/) that allow you to see what each side is saying about an issue.
> 
> Primary issues are the ones you care about most, the ones you’re determined to get right. Use the time you’ve saved from ignoring tertiary things and taking shortcuts to secondary things to learn everything there is to know about primary things.
