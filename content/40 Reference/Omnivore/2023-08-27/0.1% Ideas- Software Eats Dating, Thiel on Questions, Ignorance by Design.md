## Highlights

> Incentive systems might be one of the most under-discussed topics.   
> Here's 3 rules from Munger:   
> ​  
> • "Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives."  
> ​  
> • "The iron rule of nature is that you get what you reward for. If you want ants to come, you put sugar on the floor."  
> ​  
> • "I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it. And never a year passes but I get some surprise that pushes my limit a little farther."

> ​  
> Upstream Razor:
> 
> If somebody tells you something that goes against their incentives and identity – pay attention.
> 
> E.g. If someone tells you the worst part about living in their city or the worst part of their job – it’s usually signal rather than noise.
> 
> Why?
> 
> They’ve had to go against their identity to say it.
> 
> They’ve had to swim upstream. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/0-1-ideas-software-eats-dating-thiel-on-questions-ignorance-by-d-18a36cec7d5#d79539e0-6819-4da7-9b47-a0c20df837a6)
