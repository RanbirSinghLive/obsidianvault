## Highlights

> The most valuable personal finance asset is not needing to impress anyone. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-a-few-things-im-pretty-sure-about-0923-18ae661a9e6#ffb40305-c43f-45c4-b256-aa96a4507743) 

> The strongest-held beliefs are usually on topics with the most uncertainty. No one is as passionate about geometry as they are about religion. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-a-few-things-im-pretty-sure-about-0923-18ae661a9e6#75c0e2c2-363f-4f86-825a-0a99c81f7f5f) 

> Woodrow Wilson said government “is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton.” It’s a useful idea. Everything is accountable to one of the two, and you have to know whether something adapts and changes over time or perpetually stays the same.

> I love Brent Beshore’s observation that, “I am 100% happy to watch you get really rich doing something that I have no interest in doing.” It’s not always a competition.
