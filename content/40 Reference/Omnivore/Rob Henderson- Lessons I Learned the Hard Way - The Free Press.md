## Highlights

> Don't give [unsolicited advice](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/some-unsolicited-advice-on-unsolicited). Advice-giving inherently implies unequal status. Unless people explicitly relinquish claims to equal status by asking for advice, offering it will cultivate resentment.

> At funerals, people don’t talk about the accomplishments of the deceased. They talk about their character. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-138-a-55-ea-e-1-e-5-4-ebe-a-793-a-24-18ce494c1ba#ef165b89-8fe0-49b1-b121-bcdcb6c8a758)
