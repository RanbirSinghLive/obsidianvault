## Highlights

> My most annoying encounters are with guys who have an Econ PhD or a Harvard MBA and who think that with a half-hour of thought they can Freakonomics their way into being bestselling authors. One guy, a former high school classmate who's now a data scientist for a tech company, told me, "Have you ever considered just writing the kind of book that people would like?"
> 
> These guys have a conceptual respect for art, but they don't understand art, artistry, or ethics at all, which is a bit worrisome! They simply don't get that some things are worth making even if people don't like them, that vox populi is not in fact vox dei. Which is weird, because oftentimes these guys don't have particularly democratic principles, and in fact think the average person is stupid. It's such a contradiction that these people have an aristocratic world-view, and yet they measure their own self-worth (and that of others) through the grossest possible measurements (book sales, volume of acclaim, income, wealth, amount of money their company has raised, etc). The thing is, you can't argue with people like this, because they don't respect your opinion at all. And yet, they're almost compelled to try and put me in my place and argue with me! That's because art, to them, represents a form of respect that they can never really capture. They know on some level that their own accomplishments are hollow, and they yearn to prove that artistic achievements are equally hollow. Almost all of the really uber-techie people I know would _like_ to be artists, and many of them have music or artistic side-projects that they invest a lot of emotional energy into (think of, for instance, the [CEO of Goldman Sachs moonlighting as a DJ](https://substack.com/redirect/c6121cd5-7609-48d2-a028-ad50fc91995a?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ)). They don't really get that there's a spiritual interior to art--that success as an artist isn't about popularity, but about discovering some kind of metaphysical truth. The latter is something most real artists and writers intuitively get, which is why it's so frustrating when people don't. So, no, I don't have to defend art from tech, I find myself having to do something far harder, which is fight to distinguish true art from the weird, sad ideas that tech people have about art.
