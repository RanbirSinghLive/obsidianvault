## Highlights

> The most important decision most people will ever make is whether, when, and whom to marry. But that’s never taught in schools – how could it be? You can’t distill it down to a formula, or a one-size-fits-all answer. It’s a decision that requires lots of smarts and very little intelligence.

> historian Will Durant once said: “Logic is an invention of man and may be ignored by the universe.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-collabfund-com-blog-intelligent-vs-smart-18a79bebc9d#da2da98e-21a9-4bc1-bd15-51f9e25b0ed2) 

> Accepting that people who have lived different lives than you want different things and will see the world differently. What looks like debates are often just people with different lived experiences talking over each other.

> Charlie Munger once pointed out that Benjamin Franklin didn’t say honesty is the best morals – he said it’s the best _policy_. It’s what’s going to _help_ _you, and put you in the best position, earning you the most money_, in the long run.

> A doctor once told me there’s a difference between an expert in medicine and an expert in healthcare.
> 
> An expert in medicine knows all the right answers out of the textbook. They can diagnose with precision and are up to date on all the latest treatments.
> 
> An expert in healthcare understands that medicine from the patient’s view is intimidating, confusing, expensive, and time-consuming. Nothing you diagnose or prescribe matters until you’ve addressed that reality with patients, because even a perfect solution makes no difference to the patient who doesn’t follow it.
