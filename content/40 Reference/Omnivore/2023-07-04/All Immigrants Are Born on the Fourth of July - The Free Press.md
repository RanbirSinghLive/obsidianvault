## Highlights

> When I asked my five-year-old grandson what he knew about George Washington, all he could say was, “He owned slaves.” That’s how Washington is remembered today: slaves, bad teeth, and a face on the dollar bill. But he won the Revolutionary War by sheer force of character; the precedents he set as our first chief executive embodied the ideology of freedom and remain in effect today. Other great men of similar talents behaved quite differently. Napoleon began as [first consul](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Napoleon-I), then promoted himself to emperor. [Simón Bolívar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Simon-Bolivar) went from liberator to dictator. By contrast, Washington voluntarily and with much relief relinquished power and ended his days as a farmer at Mount Vernon. That was unusual, unlikely—and exceptional.

> The opposite of consumerism isn’t authenticity—it’s penury. It’s scarcity and hunger. We are fortunate and exceptional that most of our problems [stem from abundance](https://www.thefp.com/p/the-problem-of-abundance). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-all-immigrants-are-born-on-the-fourth-of-j-18920beef01#e9636583-68f4-4744-aa91-18469640c47b) 

> Some of you, I realize, will object to such talk of freedom and unqualified praise for our country. Half of the American economy was built on slavery, you will say. Well, yes, but as Lincoln observed, we paid for that sin with rivers of blood. Still—you will press on—we remained a legally racist country for a century after the Civil War. Well, yes, but the Civil Rights Act of 1964 broke the shackles of discrimination and today the highest-earning Americans are of Indian and East Asian descent. But this remains systemically and fundamentally a white supremacist nation, and there’s no help for that, forever and ever, you will charge, unreconciled.

> Well, no—that’s just fumes inside your head. But if you believe it, then rise to the level of the history that made you. Quit whining. Stop throwing words around and point to cases. Persuade me by engaging in respectful debate, using the shared language of reason and evidence. As so many Americans have done before, become an avatar of freedom in a time of crisis, so that your descendants long hence will look back with pride and say, “_That_ was an exceptional generation.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-all-immigrants-are-born-on-the-fourth-of-j-18920beef01#f3504334-14a0-48b4-b100-b3e2fb07eeff)
