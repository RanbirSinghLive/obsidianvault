## Highlights

> Martin Seager's that there are 3 ancient rules that make up a “script” for masculinity that men have to live up to:
> 
> 1. A real man must be a fighter and a winner
> 2. A real man must be a provider and protector (especially to women and children)
> 3. A real man must retain mastery and control at all times.
> 
> These rules are rigid and if broken can lead to a catastrophic sense of failure and masculine shame, which in turn may lead to suicide. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-menshealthforum-org-uk-what-can-tony-soprano-teach-men-187d37fddbc#a1a202f9-bf51-4a84-b7ea-ff239127a047)
