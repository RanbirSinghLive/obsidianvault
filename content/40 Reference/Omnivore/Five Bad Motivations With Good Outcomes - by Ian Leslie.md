## Highlights

> From roughly 1600 to 1900, our species endured three humblings at the hands of great thinkers. The first, courtesy of Copernicus and Galileo, was the discovery that we are not at the centre of the universe. The second, courtesy of Darwin, was that the human mind is not the glory of Creation but an accident of natural selection. The third, courtesy of Freud, was that we don’t even know our own minds, and hide our darkest thoughts from ourselves.
