## Highlights

> Genius requires vision. It requires a mind that links together ideas in strange and unpredictable ways, often leading to unprecedented, outsized outcomes. As Arthur Schopenhauer once wrote, “talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see." Think Ramanujan with math equations, Jobs with personal computing, Austen with the novel. Genius, then, is distinct from raw, intellectual horsepower.
