## Highlights

> After finishing this essay, I donated to GiveWell. Specifically their bed net program (they fund more than that). Why? Perhaps because, even if the error bars hidden behind the sale’s pitch are massive, lives are probably still saved via bed nets alone. Or perhaps selfishly, as a shield so I can’t be accused of being overly cynical. Or perhaps because I’m trying to be comfortable not having stamped approval that my donation is “saving X number of lives.” My uncertainty is vast. I’d like to think a donation does something, but, given the mysterious stalling out of effectiveness both overall on malaria progress, along with mysteries seen in the original gold-standard RCTs, and given the potential Red Queen dynamics of immunity, there’s a non-negligible chance that I could have set the money on fire and gotten the same result at this point. People might not want to hear that life is so uncertain. What I do think is that there are moments of clarity, like the big international push for bed nets and other aid in the 1990s and early 2000s that coincided with malaria deaths dropping rapidly across Africa, and in those moments the best way to help people becomes easy to identify, like a beam of sun breaking through the clouds. Just like that beautiful initial spike in the graph of the key RCT. But then the clouds close, and the clarity ends. The clarity for the effectiveness of bed nets, at least compared to other causes ([like new vaccines](https://substack.com/redirect/01b949c5-c9cb-4d96-9f05-bf29126cc852?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ)), looks to me like it closed sometime around 2015, and it’s been clouds ever since.
