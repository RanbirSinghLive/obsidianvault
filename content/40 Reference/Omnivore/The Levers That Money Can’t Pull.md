## Highlights

> There are two main types of freedom, the first of which I refer to as **self-autonomy**, and the second which I refer to as **transferred-autonomy**.
> 
> Self-autonomy is your personal ability to do what you want, whenever you want, with whom you want. In essence, it’s freedom over your attention, and the ways in which you want to allocate it. If you have enough money, you don’t need to direct your focus to obtaining more of it, which means that you don’t need to work for someone you’d rather not work for or solve a problem you’d rather not solve. This is one of the areas in which money can push this lever in a favorable direction.2
> 
> Transferred-autonomy is an extension of self-autonomy, but for many people (especially parents), it’s even more important.
> 
> Transferred-autonomy is your ability to give a loved one the ability to do what _they_ want, whenever _they_ want, with whom _they_ want. It’s when your definition of a well-lived life is also contingent upon whether you’re providing a suitable environment for a loved one to thrive. Your definition of freedom extends beyond the domain of the self, and must also encompass the freedom you help to enable in the people you love most.

> 
> From a self-autonomy perspective, you can have little money and still feel free. After all, curiosity has no price tag and the ways in which you want to express it are increasingly affordable, so a minimal lifestyle is achievable (if not sensical) with the right mindset.
> 
> But the desire for transferred-autonomy makes things tricky.
> 
> You can _personally_ be very content with little money, but that contentment will erode if you feel like you’re not giving a loved one what they need. For example, it’s easy to live the monastic life as a single person in your 20s, but damn near impossible to do so as a 40-year-old father of three. That’s because the latter situation rests heavier on your conscience, which is something that doesn’t matter as much when you’re the sole beneficiary (or victim) of your own decisions.
> 
> When you think of your children or your elderly parents, the desire to provide is often stronger than the desire to preserve. Whatever the threshold is for your own personal needs, chances are you’ve set their standards at a higher point. So from the perspective of money, what you need for yourself can be quite minimal, but what you need to have in order to properly care for them is far greater.

> You can pay for your child’s fantastic education, buy them a big house, and give them a fat brokerage account, but if they don’t feel your presence, none of this matters. **While you can use money to open up opportunities for your loved ones, the opening of all these doors is meaningless if you don’t walk through them together.** Love is shared through continuous presence, affirmation, and affection. Any attempt to use money as substitutes for these three things will ultimately be denied, or even held against you.
