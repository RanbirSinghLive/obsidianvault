## Highlights

> But according to several foresters, including Emile and Begin, this was wildly inadequate to the task. The only way to reduce the risk of a mega fire was to truly manage the forest through either selective tree removal, or straightforward clear cut logging. It would also involve aggressive measures to clear out potential fuel — ie; trees — around mountain towns.
