## Highlights

> Geniuses are not scattered uniformly through time and space. Some cultures have many more than one would expect, even after making sensible allowance for imperfect records, biased perspectives and such gross factors as famine, war, and the magnetic effect of libraries and patronage. Obvious clumps of geniuses occur in Athens, from about 440 BCE to 380 BCE, Florence, from about 1440 to 1490, London, from about 1570 to 1640.
