## Highlights

> I think my words have always been about groping for things for which we have no words, and when I succeed, people usually say I put words to thoughts they didn’t know they were thinking. That’s pretty high leverage/low wattage. I’ve been doing it guided by unconscious intuition for decades, but I’m starting to see the workings of the process itself now. I’m hoping that conscious awareness does interesting things to the words themselves. We’ll see.
