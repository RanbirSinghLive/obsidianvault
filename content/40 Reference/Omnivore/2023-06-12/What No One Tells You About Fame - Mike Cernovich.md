## Highlights

> Human connection is the _sine qua non_ of the human experience. When you lose the ability to **connect through shared stories and mutual vulnerability**, you lose what it means to be human. This is also why famous people often have breakdowns, failed relationships, and sometimes vanish to the wilderness.

> I thought it was nice to answer emails, but the replies kept coming, and how can I keep up? People take your inattention personally. Everyone thinks they are the center of the universe, and how dare you not drop everything you are doing to listen to their bullshit.

> (I’m going to be a bunch of emails and texts from people asking if the above paragraphs are about them. That is how self-absorbed people are. They can’t read an article, empathize with me, and instead will make it about themselves.)
