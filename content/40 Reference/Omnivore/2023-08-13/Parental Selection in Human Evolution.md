## Highlights

> The “self-domestication hypothesis” is the idea that in the ancestral environment, early human communities collectively killed individuals prone to certain forms of aggression: arrogance, bullying, random violence, and monopolizing food and sexual partners.
> 
> Over time, our ancestors eliminated humans—typically males—who were exceedingly aggressive toward members of their own group. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/parental-selection-in-human-evolution-189ef0177f1#948412ba-da92-4764-9db4-67c30137fa99) 

> ### **Infant Crying as Signaling**
> 
> Intriguingly, some researchers have [suggested](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/6b41b98c-345a-4c25-9e14-449d9c944bec?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) that infant crying is a [signal](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/e3ac84c3-df9e-4109-af1e-fe8395cebc24?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) of vigor that evolved to reduce the withdrawal of parental care. 
> 
> The idea is that in the ancestral environment, inert, inanimate, lifeless infants were considered by parents to be physically weak or possibly in poor health and thus unlikely to survive. In contrast, being loud and relentlessly fussy demonstrated high energy, strong lungs, and good health. Indeed, infant crying is calorically costly, with a 13% increase in metabolic rate compared to resting.

> Exhausted parent: “I’ve tried feeding you, changing you, holding you…What is it that you want?”
> 
> Crying baby: “To demonstrate to you how robust I am!” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/parental-selection-in-human-evolution-189ef0177f1#f2a0145e-0b90-48ad-8f00-5f24a219807d)
