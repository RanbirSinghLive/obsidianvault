## Highlights

> Class conflict is an idea traditionally associated with Marxism, however over the past century there have been a multitude of thinkers who noticed that Marxist class categories were hopelessly outdated in modern economies. Modern politics have similarly outgrown the class-based assumptions of yesteryear; left-wing parties around the world have swapped out their formerly working class voter base for a high-income, highly-educated professional worker base. The [Democrats](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-being-party-rich-could-cost-them-2024-election-1806747) in the [US](https://unherd.com/2022/05/how-the-democrats-became-the-party-of-the-rich/), the [Liberal Party in Canada](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/election-insights-why-rich-canadians-are-all-in-for-the-liberals), the Labour Party in both [Britain](https://www.privatebankerinternational.com/news/wealthy-brits-would-support-labour-and-believe-keir-starmer-will-triumph/) and [Australia](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10880457/Why-Labor-relies-rich-voters-stay-power-despite-cost-living-electricity-bills-crisis.html), and pretty much every other mainstream left-wing political party in the developed world have all become parties run by the highly educated, for the highly educated.

> “Middle-class youths strive for a college degree to ascend the social ladder. But because the true elites are always a small group, an excess of college graduates saturates the job market with mid-level managers. As these managers fight for scarce spots at the top, intra-elite jockeying becomes more fierce. Tests of ideological purity become a way of winnowing the competition. Those most insecure in their elite status do the most virtue signaling, and punch down on the “unenlightened” lower white classes as a way of confirming their rank. Ultimately, these people end up filling the ever-increasing number of mid-level positions in government, media, and universities.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-0-d-11-af-84-e-83-f-4-eaf-bf-31-61-f-18f7ee42fde#8ecab82f-745b-447c-9899-554f04e5ec55) 

> Other honourable mentions abound for how to label the new upper class, from Coastal/Laurentian Elites to Yuppies to [Virtue Hoarders](https://mronline.org/2021/10/28/the-new-dangerous-class-the-pmc-and-virtue-hoarding/). For the sake of simplicity, throughout the rest of this piece I’ll refer to 21st century class distinctions as follows:
> 
> 1. **The Shareholder Class**. The billionaires and centimillionaires. Numerically insignificant for electoral purposes, but wielding outsized economic power.
> 2. **The Laptop Class**. [Affluent but not necessarily wealthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W726xNPtEbQ); they manage and oversee the bureaucracies/corporations/foundations owned by the Shareholder Class. A politically dominant plurality in major cities across developed countries, but nowhere near a national majority in any country. They do however have hegemonic control over nearly all major institutions and sites of cultural production.
> 3. **The Physical Class**. They don’t have the luxury of working from home, and don’t hold your breath for them to be able to name 70 different genders, but they’re the reason modern societies are still able to function. They’re the largest voting demographic by class, though they typically don’t vote as a single bloc for various reasons such as urban/rural divides.
> 4. **The Welfare Class**. Chronically unemployed for various reasons, they are entirely dependent on the state (_or else live off petty crime_) and have skyhigh rates of substance abuse. Voter turnout is generally low to nonexistent. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-0-d-11-af-84-e-83-f-4-eaf-bf-31-61-f-18f7ee42fde#1c3b33c2-c8e8-4617-9cbd-73b5dbd4f709) 

> “Covid revealed something very important about our societies: They are fantastically vulnerable to even tiny and temporary disruptions, especially when it comes to the circulatory systems of commodities, goods, transport, and services”
> 
> “Because our systems are now so fragile, even tiny groups of workers can cause serious damage to the smooth functioning of the economy, as long as they are located in strategic sectors.”
> 
> “Logistical chaos—at airports, rail junctions, and ports—is an indicator of the massive veto power accrued by people whose wage labor is necessary to prevent chaos. It is only a matter of time before angry workers exercise that power on a grander scale.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-0-d-11-af-84-e-83-f-4-eaf-bf-31-61-f-18f7ee42fde#624442d0-fb9f-4cd2-a888-f91c5aa2767c)
