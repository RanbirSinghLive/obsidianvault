## Highlights

> This story comes via an Inquisitive Bird [substack covering the subject](https://inquisitivebird.substack.com/p/when-few-do-great-harm?r=8su7h&utm%5Fmedium=ios&utm%5Fcampaign=post) of power laws in crime. Power laws, whereby a small number of people tend to be responsible for a huge proportion of any phenomenon, can be found in all human activity, whether it be income, book sales by authors, or number of sexual partners; the most well-known, [the Pareto principle,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto%5Fprinciple) or the 80/20 rule, originally comes from Italian land ownership.

> Lawbreaking, too, observes a power law, so that a huge proportion of crime is committed by a very small number of offenders who have an outsized impact on society.

> The social and economic downsides of crime are enormous; Ben Southwood has estimated the cost [in the US to be in the trillions, a huge](https://bensouthwood.substack.com/p/how-bad-is-crime) part of which is due to crime avoidance. As Southwood notes, higher crimes causes society as a whole to become antisocial: ‘People who fear new neighbours have a substantial risk of committing crimes tend to oppose new development nearby, and to live in extremely spread out “sprawl” suburbs, where sheer walking distance between places makes crime more difficult. What’s more, people in high-crime areas prefer to travel with metal shields around them at all times – that is by car – causing dramatically higher carbon emissions. By contrast ultra-low-crime Japan is tolerant of high density development throughout its cities, and rates of cycling, walking, and transit use are all extremely high, while carbon emissions are much lower.’ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-substack-com-redirect-fc-40-af-51-dead-42-ed-bf-92-52-e-1--18bb13f5e5e#6d45a644-a8eb-4486-9e2a-6b7687ed7203)
