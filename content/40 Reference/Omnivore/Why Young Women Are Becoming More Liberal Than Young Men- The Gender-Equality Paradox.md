## Highlights

> In an [interview](https://substack.com/redirect/7f904a0d-c607-4001-a344-d15297228191?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) in The Times of London, the psychologist Steve Stewart-Williams succinctly summarized the paradox: “Treating men and women the same makes them different, and treating them differently makes them the same.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/why-young-women-are-becoming-more-liberal-than-young-men-the-gen-18ffc73204c#4a1acfb5-ad12-49d0-b74b-540e602d0e2a) 

> There are a variety of possible explanations for the gender-equality paradox, but one prevailing view is that as societies become relatively more prosperous and equal, people more fully express their underlying traits and preferences.
> 
> Of course, culture matters in explaining gender differences — just not in the way most people think.
> 
> In less affluent and less egalitarian societies, gender differences in physical traits are flattened due to scarcity — that is, the shortage of food and other resources stunts growth, especially for men, leading to smaller physical disparities. Moreover, gender differences in psychological traits narrow in response to rigid social expectations.

> In the most equal nations of the world, it’s not harsh gender socialization by parents and media, strict societal expectations, or institutional forces that widen the differences between men and women. In the absence of dire poverty and strict social expectations, people are in a position to express their intrinsic attributes and preferences.

> The freer people are and the more fairly they are treated, the more differences tend to grow rather than shrink. Thus, we shouldn’t be surprised that Gen Z men and women are diverging along political lines to a greater extent than earlier generations did.
