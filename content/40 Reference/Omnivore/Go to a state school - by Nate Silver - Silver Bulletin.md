## Highlights

> I explore the clash between two rival clans of elites — the analytical, risk-taking professions like finance and tech\[4\] that I call “the River” on the one hand, and a triad of more intellectual professions (academia, the media and government) that I call “the Village” on the other hand. In the book, I argue that these groups are natural rivals — and their clashes have become more explicit recently, like in Wall Street and Silicon Valley helping to lead the charge against the university presidents.
