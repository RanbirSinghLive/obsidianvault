## Highlights

> Rituals surrounding death do seem to help bereaving family members. Or at least reduce suffering. A classic study [found](https://substack.com/redirect/d8288c57-2fa4-4e24-a489-ef3a2e4332f3?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) that the absence of a funeral ceremony predicted prolonged grief (as measured by disrupted work, upsetting dreams, and increased likelihood of reporting illness).
