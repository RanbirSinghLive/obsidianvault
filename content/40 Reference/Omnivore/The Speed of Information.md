## Highlights

> When the American Civil War began in April 1861, the US Military Telegraph Corps. laid “15,000 miles of telegraph wire across battlefields that transmitted news nearly instantaneously from the front lines”, per [_History_](https://link.workweek.com/click/33026553.35211/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGlzdG9yeS5jb20vbmV3cy9hYnJhaGFtLWxpbmNvbG4tdGVsZWdyYXBoLWNpdmlsLXdhcg/6455eb6b00a06274a5228873B2acc001b).
> 
> All communications from that telegraph network — literally 100% — was sent to the library room of the War Department, which was next to the White House.

> 
> Other than the White House, Lincoln spent more time in the telegraph room than any other place during the Civil War:
> 
> _David Homer Bates, one of the four original members of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps, recounted in “Lincoln in the Telegraph Room” that several times a day, Lincoln sat down at a telegraph office desk near a window overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue and read through the fresh stack of incoming telegrams, which he called “lightning messages.” As telegraph keys chattered, he peered over the shoulders of the operators who scribbled down the incoming messages converted from Morse Code. He visited the office nearly every night before turning in and slept there on a cot during pivotal battles._ 
> 
> From 1861-1865, the President of the United States was the _only_ person in the country receiving all the flow of information related to the war (the Confederates never built a comparable telegraph network).
> 
> Today, literally billions of people are being flooded with images, intel, news, updates and propaganda at every waking second. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-speed-of-information-18b2dbcc830#6ec4ceb2-5523-41be-acf4-958e6b7d0f22)
