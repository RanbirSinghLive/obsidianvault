## Highlights

> _Many ideas for technology just seem to be ripe, and ready to fall from the tree. The most astonishing case is the electric light bulb, the invention of which was independently achieved by twenty-one people…Likewise, there were scores of different search engines coming to the market in the 1990s. It was impossible for search engines not to be invented in the 1990s, and impossible for light bulbs not to be invented in the 1870s._
> 
> _\[…\] People seem to stumble on the same idea at the same time. Kevin Kelly explores this phenomenon in his book “What Technology Wants”, finding that six different people invented or discovered the thermometer, five the electric telegraph, four decimal fractions, three the hypodermic needle, two natural selection._ 
> 
> _In 1922 William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas at Columbia University produced a list of 148 cases of near-simultaneous invention by more than one person, including photography, the telescope and typewriters…Going further back still, it is striking that the boomerang, the blowpipe and the pyramid were all invented independently on different continents – as was agriculture._
> 
> _\[…\] without Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace did get natural selection in the 1850s; without Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorenz would have got relativity within a few years; without Leo Szilard, the chain reaction and the fission bomb would have been invented in the twentieth century at some point; without Watson and Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Ray Gosling would have got the structure of DNA within months – William Astbury and Elwyn Beighton already had got the key evidence a year earlier but did not realize it._ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-trungphan-substack-com-p-11-types-of-cross-industry-innova-187cdd6cee5#c1b914e1-5b4d-4991-bb11-a85cb697875a) 

> a pipeline of cross-industry innovations from NASA. When the space organization was established in 1958, part of its mandate was to commercialize technology that came out of the research process.
> 
> To date, there have been 2000+ commercialized products and services (called "NASA spin-off technologies") including: 
> 
> * CAT Scans (the space program required quality digital images)
> * Baby formula (an algae-based ingredient was created to make space food long-lasting and nutritious)
> * Foil blankets (lightweight insulated blankets often used in emergency settings)
> * Memory foam (created to make space pilot seats more comfortable)
> * Home insulation (created to deal with extreme space temperature fluctuations)
> * Computer mouse (originally designed to manipulate computers on space crafts)
> * Ear thermometer (originally used to measure astronaut temperature)
> * Freeze-dried food (self-explanatory)
> * Cell phone cameras (small — but powerful — cameras needed for space flight)
> * Scratch-resistant lenses (from diamond-hard coatings on space vehicles)
> * Water-purification (originally created for astronaut drinking water and now deployed for killing bacteria in pools)
> * Athletic shoes (shock absorbers from the space suits)
> * Black &amp; Decker Dustbuster vacuum (original device collected dust from the moon)
> 
> There have been so many spin-offs that [NASA has a web portal and print publication to catalog them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA%5Fspinoff%5Ftechnologies). That is one impressive list but NASA also makes clear that it _didn’t_ create three other product often attributed to the agency: Tang, Velcro, Teflon.
