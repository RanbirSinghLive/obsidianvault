## Highlights

> The aisles of the Blockbuster were themed, though less aggressively, less knowingly than the rows that march relentlessly down the Netflix home page. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-thewalrus-ca-life-in-the-stacks-a-love-letter-to-browsing-18a12e6eff2#c8fbe8df-b7dd-4bf4-ae3d-751dbb5519d8) 

> But speed of scrolling, algorithmic assistance, and instant access weren’t what my friends and I needed, even if we might’ve welcomed them as conveniences. We needed that long subway trip downtown. (We were the farthest stop west.) We needed the sobering disappointments and sporadic victories. We needed the longueurs that new technology seeks to close, as if abolishing boredom ever does anyone a favour. Mostly, we needed wind resistance. It took effort to cultivate our enthusiasms in a desert, but it’s clear now that we took the desert’s role for granted. Knowledge tends to stick when you’ve toiled for it.

> In the early days—when few of us possessed laptops and social media had yet to metastasize—I loved getting lost in the library stacks. I whiled away breaks between classes by stumbling on books that had nothing to do with my assignments. Within a decade, though, the library’s patrons were conspicuously immobile: they sat along walls and in alcoves, laptops open on their laps, serenely siloed against the press of books all around. It was almost creepy. If the essay they were writing called for a quote, they could call up a PDF from an electronic journal. No physical labour required—just a cursory search, a cut and paste. The students had become scrollers, and the indifference of so many of them to the very stacks I used to haunt was heartbreaking.

> I don’t offer a program of resistance except to say: when culture is a literal click away, you should want to slow down and conjure some hurdles, make consumption a gradation harder. Cut down on your web-based content, maybe. Balk at the bingeable. Use the internet, if you must, but as a delivery system. (Go ahead and buy those expensive Criterion DVDs.) Revel in what arrives in the good old mail and spurn what comes too easily. Seek out first editions, rare albums, out-of-print movies, old numbers of magazines someone took the care to shrink-wrap. When not in lockdown owing to a global pandemic, visit bookstores and record shops, and often. Arrange to forget your smartphone and contrive to be alone. You will be amazed at what lies just out of view of the scroll.
