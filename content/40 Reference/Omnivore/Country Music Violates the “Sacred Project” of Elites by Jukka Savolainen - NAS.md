## Highlights

> In 2014, the Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith published a book entitled _The Sacred Project of American Sociology_, Professor Smith presented a sharply critical appraisal of the “not-so-hidden-agenda” governing his own academic field. According to Smith, sociology has evolved from a scientific discipline into an activist project with a quasi-religious mission “to dismantle the powerful vestiges of inequality, exploitation, and repression.” Instead of pursuing truth, academic sociology is pursuing a social change agenda consistent with the narrative that the American society is an oppressive regime that discriminates against women, minorities, and other marginalized groups.
