## Highlights

> Arguably — and this is an 80s upbringing armed with _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ talking — _worldly, yet carefree_ is the ideal attitude for the vast majority of the world to adopt almost all the time. It allows you to enjoy life, do your bit, and be rationally invested in the fate of the world without being overwhelmed by your sense of its troubles. When humor must escape the world to find laughs, it is not as satisfying. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/worldly-yet-carefree-18cfe8facf0#f4a9bf18-8531-46dd-846a-ab14b27cf0a9)
