## Highlights

> Motivation is at least as important as method for the serious thinker, Shockley believed...the essential element for successful work in any field was “the will to think”. This was a phrase he learned from the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi and never forgot. “In these four words,” Shockley wrote later, “\[Fermi\] distilled the essence of a very significant insight: A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack ‘the will to think’ -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the results of his efforts.” The discipline of competent thinking is important throughout life...

> How many people actually go back and try and understand this, or other such topics, in a deeper way? Very few. Moreover, the ‘meta’ lesson is: don’t question it too deeply, you’ll fall behind. Just learn the algorithm, plug in the numbers, and pass your exams. Speed is of the essence. In this way, school kills the “will to understanding” in people.

> My countervailing advice to people trying to understand something is: **go slow**. Read slowly, think slowly, really spend time pondering the thing. Start by thinking about the question yourself before reading a bunch of stuff about it. A week or a month of continuous pondering about a question will get you surprisingly far. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-things-nabeel-s-qureshi-18f7d57d31f#56ca27eb-351a-426d-96b6-7188c7107079) 

> The point of both of these parables: nothing beats direct experience. Get the data yourself. This is why I wanted to analyze the [coronavirus genome](https://github.com/nqureshi/sars-cov-2/blob/master/SARS-Cov-2.ipynb) directly, for example. You develop some basis in reality by getting some first-hand data, and reasoning up from there, versus starting with somebody else’s lossy compression of a messy, evolving phenomenon and then wondering why events keep surprising you.
> 
> People who have not experienced the thing are unlikely to be generating truth. More likely, they’re resurfacing cached thoughts and narratives. Reading popular science books or news articles is not a substitute for understanding, and may make you stupider, by filling your mind with narratives and stories that don’t represent _your own synthesis_.

> Even if you can’t experience the thing directly, try going for information-dense sources with high amounts of detail and facts, and then reason up from those facts. On foreign policy, read books published by university presses -- not The Atlantic or The Economist or whatever. You can read those after you’ve developed a model of the thing yourself, against which you can judge the popular narratives.

> The photographer Robert Capa advised beginning photographers: “_If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enoug_h”. (This is good fiction writing advice, by the way.)

> It is also good advice for understanding things. When in doubt, go closer. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-understand-things-nabeel-s-qureshi-18f7d57d31f#275dab04-51cb-4f0a-b4f3-53429b8183fc)
