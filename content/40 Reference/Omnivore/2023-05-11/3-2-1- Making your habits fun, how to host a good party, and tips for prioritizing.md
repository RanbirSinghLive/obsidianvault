## Highlights

> Actress and dancer **Joan Crawford** on how to host a good party: 
> 
> “The best parties are a wild mixture. Take some corporation presidents, add a bearded painter, a professional jockey, your visiting friends from Brussels, a politician, a hairdresser, and a professor of physics, toss them all together, and try to get them to stop talking long enough to eat! 
> 
> It's especially important to have all age groups. I've never noticed any generation gap. All the younger people I know are bright and attractive and have something to say and they dress like human beings. They love to listen, too. They make wonderful guests."
