## Highlights

> Money is carbon. That was the slogan. In 1971 the US abolished the last remnants of the gold standard in favor of a discretionary monetary policy in which the value of a dollar was backed solely by government authority. This enabled the central banks to steer currency flows and maintain a relatively stable period of economic growth, less a few relatively short crashes. Only in the 21st century did we start to realized that the key externality of the new Keynesian system had turned out to be a failure mode that was entirely invisible to economists’ models; the gradual accumulation of carbon emissions in the earth’s atmosphere. 
> 
> Under the post-new Keynesian synthesis, as elaborated by the eminent Swedish economist N’Buqu Muguwata, the true backing of any unit of currency is the expected carbon footprint of its expenditure. Government fiat was therefore offering money at a steep and unsustainable discount, and the next step in the evolution of money was to move from money as a debt owed by the bank (gold) to money as pure unit of exchange (fiat) to money as a debt owed by each individual person to the earth.
