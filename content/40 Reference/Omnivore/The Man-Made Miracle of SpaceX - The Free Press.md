## Highlights

> But if the Starship program meets its goal of full reusability, the cargo-cost-per-kilogram could be just ten dollars. The implications of this number are profound. Just think what happened as computers became 99 percent cheaper over time: what used to fill up a room and cost a fortune now fits in our pocket and is accessible to billions of people. When it becomes dramatically cheaper to get heavy things into space, a new paradigm opens up: we can build orbital factories to take advantage of microgravity for manufacturing, or move a lot of mass to the moon or to Mars—enough to start a colony some day. The cost of cargo on Starship could be so low that the Air Force has [contracted SpaceX](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/spacex-signs-a-deal-to-rocket-military-cargo-around-the-world/) to explore using Starship for military cargo flights to anywhere on Earth in under one hour.
