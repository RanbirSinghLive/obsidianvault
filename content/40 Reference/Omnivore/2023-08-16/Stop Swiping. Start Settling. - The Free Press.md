## Highlights

> The study revealed a stunning 30 percentage point happiness gap between married and unmarried Americans.As the American Perspectives Survey report notes, “No social change has altered the fabric of American life so profoundly as the decline of marriage.”  [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-dating-apps-decline-of-marriage-189fe2c5509#359195e2-2fc0-4c61-a1c1-d3aba1abc2b7) 

> Relative to men, a larger percentage of women say that “not being able to find someone who meets their expectations” is a major reason they are single. If you’re a woman, and you decide to rule out everyone who is right of center, and you want someone with a commensurate degree (young men continue to [drop out](https://www.thefp.com/p/americas-lost-boys-and-me) of education and the workforce), then your dating pool will be very small indeed. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-thefp-com-p-dating-apps-decline-of-marriage-189fe2c5509#67ebad4b-b967-4304-9e6d-cee1bbfebcd4) 

> These two factors—demanding more of your partner and understanding that abundance is not always favorable or desirable—should be a lesson that will guide us toward healthier and more fulfilling relationships. Shutting off the dating apps and reducing our choices will actually give us a greater appetite for love.
