## Highlights

> Humanity has lived through several cognitive revolutions already. The development of various writing systems around the world; the invention of the printing press; the formulation of the heliocentric hypothesis by Copernicus; Darwin’s theory of evolution; Einstein’s theory of relativity—all of these discoveries have fundamentally reshaped the way we think.

> Networked thinking is an explorative approach to problem-solving, whose aim is to consider the complex interactions between nodes and connections in a given problem space. Instead of considering a particular problem in isolation to discover a pre-existing solution, networked thinking encourages non-linear, second-order reflection in order to let a new idea emerge. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#05f0d9b6-c579-41de-a137-dd6cb988d816) 

> Thinking in networks can be done at an individual level, but the power of networked thinking becomes apparent in a collaborative setting, where each individual contributes to the creation of new branches and the addition of new connections between existing nodes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#6f957dd9-cae2-4753-9367-964ad028b745) 

> “The idea of human as networker is fast replacing the idea of human as toolmaker in the story of the human brain,” write archaeologists Clive Gamble and John Gowlett and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar in the book [Thinking Big](https://amzn.to/33RqcUD). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#ff8a43a4-45c4-4e86-b1b5-06e530cf050a) 

> The real kicker? “The clusters extended to three degrees of separation.” It means that people who had never met in person were influencing each others’ weight. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#192182b3-e581-4bad-ae06-be3c01d3d81c) 

> Conventional wisdom suggests that people with stronger ties with others will better disseminate ideas. However, [research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392) into interpersonal networks shows that people with weaker ties are better influencers, because they tend to be part of more clusters of people—they are effectively connected to more nodes in the network. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#99d96fe7-a1c2-48a9-94ed-1071a515266a) 

> Networked thinking is based on two key principles: divergence and emergence. Starting from any relevant node in the network, the divergent phase consists in branching out from that original point in many directions, without trying to evaluate the validity of any particular idea. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#c7bcdf10-4dde-4925-b8f2-bdd057e6b4ac) 

> When enough nodes are added to the network, patterns start to emerge. It may be specific clusters, or strong ties between particular nodes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#623e2962-98c9-4b7a-bfcf-a8646a5feda3) 

> Akin to the infinite patterns of fractals found in natural creativity, such networks of knowledge feed themselves, resulting in repetitive branching. The infinite nature of thinking maps may sound daunting, but that is exactly what makes them such amazing knowledge discovery tools. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#9c7dab6c-fdce-41b5-b4b5-95d52b906161) 

> We are witnessing the advent of a new category of [tools for thought](https://nesslabs.com/topic/tools) that can help us “see further into the nature of things”, in parallel with emerging research in the field of augmented intelligence (also known as cognitive augmentation)—where technology is designed to enhance human intelligence rather than replace it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/networked-thinking-a-quiet-cognitive-revolution-ness-labs-189fe6f830c#421c733d-b61e-4630-ba28-c7449cc09541) 

> Breaking the mould of categorical thinking, where the goal is to determine fixed boundaries and which pushes us to set arbitrary thresholds for decisions, networked thinking encourages unbounded exploration, where the explorer needs to be comfortable with the idea of not having a specified destination. When it comes to knowledge, there is no “end of the road”—networked thinking is all about embracing the chaotic nature of the journey.
