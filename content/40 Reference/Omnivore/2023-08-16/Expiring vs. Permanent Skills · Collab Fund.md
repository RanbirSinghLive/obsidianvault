## Highlights

> Every field has two kinds of skills:
> 
> * **Expiring skills**, which are vital at a given time but prone to diminishing as technology improves and a field evolves.
> * **Permanent skills**, which were as essential 100 years ago as they are today, and will still be 100 years from now. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/expiring-vs-permanent-skills-collab-fund-18a01609131#56a2651b-2625-4f9d-b359-87706332a0bc)
