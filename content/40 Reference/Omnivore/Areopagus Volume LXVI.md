## Highlights

> Dirk Willems was born in a Dutch town called Asperen in the 16th century, at a time when Europe was in the throes of religious and political strife caused by the Protestant Reformation and the subsequent reaction of the Catholic Church. We can say little with certainty about his life other than that, at some point, he went to the city of Rotterdam and was there _rebaptised_ as an adult. And so Willems became an Anabaptist — he believed that baptism should be a _conscious decision_ rather than one taken on behalf of children. This was in direct contravention to established doctrine in both the Catholic Church and most of the major, recently-founded Protestant Churches. As such, Anabaptists were persecuted by all sides for their beliefs, and Willems was no different; after holding rebaptisms in his own house he was arrested and tried. I shall let Thieleman J. van Braght, whose 1680 book _Martyr's Mirror_ compiled the stories of Christian martyrs, tell you the rest:
> 
> Concerning his apprehension, it is stated by trustworthy persons, that when he fled he was hotly pursued by a thief-catcher, and as there had been some frost, said Dirk Willems ran before over the ice, getting across with considerable peril. The thief-catcher following him broke through, when Dirk Willems, perceiving that the former was in danger of his life, quickly returned and aided him in getting out, and thus saved his life. The thiefcatcher wanted to let him go, but the burgomaster, very sternly called to him to consider his oath, and thus he was again seized by the thief-catcher, and, at said place, after severe imprisonment and great trials proceeding from the deceitful papists, put to death at a lingering fire...
> 
> The document which recorded Willems' trial has also survived:
> 
> Whereas, Dirk Willems, born at Asperen, at present a prisoner, has, without torture and iron bonds (or otherwise) before the bailiff and us judges, confessed that at, the age of fifteen, eighteen or twenty years, he was rebaptized in Rotterdam, at the house of one Pieter Willems, and that he, further, in Asperen, at his house, at divers hours, harbored and admitted secret conventicles and prohibited doctrines, and that he also has permitted several persons to be rebaptized in his aforesaid house; all of which is contrary to our holy Christian faith, and to the decrees of his royal majesty, and ought not to be tolerated, but severely punished, for an example to others; therefore, we the aforesaid judges, having, with mature deliberation of council, examined and considered all that was to be considered in this matter, have condemned and do condemn by these presents in the name; and in the behalf, of his royal majesty, as Count of Holland, the aforesaid Dirk Willems, prisoner, persisting obstinately in his opinion, that he shall be executed with fire, until death ensues; and declare all his property confiscated, for the benefit of his royal majesty. So done this 16th of May, in presence of the judges Cornelis Goverts, Jan van Stege Jans, Adriaen Gerritts, Adriaen Jans, Lucas Rutgers, Jan Jans, and Jan Roefelofs, A. D., 1569.
> 
> Willems must have known that stopping to save his pursuer made his recapture likely (along with the inevitable torture and execution that would follow) and yet he did so anyway. Doing the right thing was more important, for Willems, than escaping with his life. _He made a choice_ — and people still talk about him to this day, taking inspiration from that single, courageous decision. You can see why Willems' startling example of moral integrity has made him a figure of immense veneration for so long, both among Anabaptists and further afield.
