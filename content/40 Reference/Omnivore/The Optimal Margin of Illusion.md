## Highlights

> A few years ago, a [study](https://substack.com/redirect/d3b9fcae-881a-45a5-a4d6-796496f9b4c5?j=eyJ1IjoiMmRhb2g5In0.wNQVXQHZPXVUS1Y9mudnycQLeZdn6NlNz8QmOlkqvQQ) on online dating found that people tend to reach up the hierarchy toward potential partners who are more desirable than themselves. On average, people pursued partners who are 25% more desirable than they themselves are.
> 
> This is consistent with what the psychologist Roy Baumeister has described as the “optimal margin of illusion.” Generally, people believe they themselves are 10-20% better than they really are.

> an old sociology concept called The Thomas theorem:
> 
> “If men believe a situation is real, it becomes real in its consequences.”
> 
> One example is believing in a toilet paper shortage. Another is soldiers throwing down their weapons and running away because they believe the battle is lost.
> 
> Perhaps this also applies to our tendency to self-enhance. If we regard ourselves to be a little bit better than we really are, we can make it into a reality. And accomplish things we otherwise might not have. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimal-margin-of-illusion-18c2f5afd61#82fd8373-4c17-4fb4-8478-1a47311f120d) 

> The historian John Lewis Gaddis has defined grand strategy as “The study of how to achieve aspirational ends with limited means.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimal-margin-of-illusion-18c2f5afd61#dc18f17a-5442-4b57-9bef-f5a91cdce465) 

> This reminds me of other research suggesting that one reason why men don’t visit doctors as often as women, even when they suffer from health issues, is because they don’t want to know about potentially detrimental health issues that could reduce the confidence they project to the world. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-optimal-margin-of-illusion-18c2f5afd61#25eff130-639e-46c0-afda-ca0f8d264cfe) 

> The tendency to view ourselves through a slightly enhanced lens is not just a quirk of human nature, but a (largely unconscious) strategy that improves our odds of real-world success. It's a delicate balance. Too much self-inflation risks detachment from reality. Too little can undermine our aspirations. A _slightly_ enhanced self-image, grounded in a realistic assessment of your capabilities and limitations, can help you to achieve your most important goals.
