## Highlights

> The advent of fMRI _was_ undeniably a boon for understanding the brain’s inner workings—and the public loved learning about the findings. Neuroscience validated things we already intuitively felt were true: that our minds process [emotional pain similarly to physical pain](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1102693108), that we all have knee-jerk reactions t[o faces of people who are a different race than us](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10943684/), that [something special happens when we look at someone we love](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327739/). With these new imaging tools, we could better understand ourselves and how we change over our life spans.
