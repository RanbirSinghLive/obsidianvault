## Highlights

> At every step of communication technology, textual encoding comes first, everything else after. Because it's _vastly cheaper_ on a symbol-by-symbol basis. You have a working [optical telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical%5Ftelegraph) network running in _1790_ in France. You the better part of a century of [electrical telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical%5Ftelegraph), trans-oceanic cables and everything, before anyone bothers with trying to carry voice. You have decades of teleprinter and text-only computer networking, mail and news, chat and publishing, editing and diagnostics, before bandwidth gets cheap enough for images, voice and video. You have pagers, SMS, WAP, USSD and blackberries before iPhones. You have [Teletext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) and BBSs, netnews and gopher before the web. And today many of the best, and certainly the most efficient parts of the web remain text-centric. I can download _all of wikipedia_ and carry it around on the average smartphone.
