## Highlights

> I know a few people who I believe to be geniuses. What happens when I tell them that I believe they’re a genius? They all tell me that there are people smarter than them and that they’re “only pretty good at one or two things”
> 
> bitch this is exactly what genius is. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/intelligence-killed-genius-alexey-guzey-18ac30307a3#c53c2ab1-cb0c-4b2e-98d8-90ab4284a030)
