## Highlights

> Apart from tending to his farm and his three daughters — Dylan, Lola and Cecile — McMillan, who just bought a place in Pointe-Claire to be closer to his kids in Dorval, has some intriguing fantasies — even for him.
> 
> “I want to work at Home Depot in the tool or wood section or as an orderly in the emergency department at the Lakeshore General Hospital. I just want a boss and a shift. I’ll work at the hospital for free. I need structure and not to be the boss. My mom has spent a long time working in palliative care and finds it really rewarding. Maybe I should,” he said before quickly musing: “I never want to shave white truffles on to asparagus for someone from Toronto ever again in my life.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-montrealgazette-com-opinion-columnists-brownstein-burned-o-18a6f04ef5d#fc9d2037-3144-4fb0-9fdd-40866337ffd7)
