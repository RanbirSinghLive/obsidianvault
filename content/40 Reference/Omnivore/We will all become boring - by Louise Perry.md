## Highlights

> Another form of social capital that will likely wax and wane over the course of your life is how much fun you are. The example of this I like to give comes from the very charming TV series _Derry Girls_, set in a working class family in 1990s Derry. The show revolves around a group of teenage girls who are obsessed with their own petty dramas, as teenagers usually are. One of the recurrent characters is a boring old bloke called [Uncle Colm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm0RbUdXDMM). The girls roll their eyes at Uncle Colm and can’t understand why they have to spend time with him. The adults also find him tedious, but nevertheless continue to invite him along to family events, because their culture is still traditional enough to regard this intra-familial hospitality as an obligation. The girls don’t think about this (why would they?), but the truth is that if Uncle Colm wasn’t invited to family Sunday dinners he wouldn’t be invited to anything at all. No one would choose to spend their time with him. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/we-will-all-become-boring-by-louise-perry-18ccbb05651#69f93d0c-5881-4db1-9ad9-c228e4a0f670) 

> But there is a trade off. At a societal level, we can be rich, or we can be communitarian. I don’t think we can be both – at least, not for long. The Baby Boomers came closest to enjoying both simultaneously, but only because they were born during an ideological changing of the guard. They enjoyed the high trust, family-centric culture cultivated by their parents and grandparents, and then got to enjoy the youthful rejection of all of that culture’s downsides.

> But that’s a trick that can only be pulled once. Historian (and Baby Boomer) Jon Lawrence is kidding himself when he tries to have it both ways:
> 
> > \[W\]e should read the widespread nostalgia for community as powerful evidence that people want to find a way to reconcile personal freedom – the right not to have to conform to the expectations of strangers (or indeed of family) – with a deeper sense of social connection.⁠7
> 
> I have bad news on this front: those things are irreconcilable. You cannot promote a culture of optionality, and then also expect people to _choose you_ when you become a dull and onerous option. You cannot buy solitude when it suits you, and then try and buy back company when it does not, because company of the sincere and intimate kind cannot be bought.

> The message of The Villages is this: that the true purpose of human life is to have fun, to drink and play golf, and you can only really experience the true purpose of human life once you’ve retired: when you’ve nothing left to do but exist. You are not old, because age is just a number. You do not need to be looked after. What you need is to start living your best life. When they were young, the Baby Boomers broke apart the multi-generational community: untempered youth, wild youth leading itself towards its own ends. Now, they’re doing it again. They have absconded from their duty as old people, which is to be the link between the future and the past—because the world doesn’t have a past anymore, and precious little future either. You are suspended in an infinite present. You still wear blue jeans. You will never die.
