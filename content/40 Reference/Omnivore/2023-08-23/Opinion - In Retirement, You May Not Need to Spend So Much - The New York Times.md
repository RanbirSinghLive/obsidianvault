> Americans in their 80s on average feel less financially constrained than Americans in their 50s, which indicates that in most cases the retirees are spending less because they want to, not because they have to, the researchers found. Their findings were based on a 2019 [mail survey](https://archive.fo/o/AqKOO/https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/news/data-announcements/2019-consumption-and-activities-mail-survey-cams-2019-final-version-10) that’s part of the long-running [Health and Retirement Survey](https://archive.fo/o/AqKOO/https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about), which is conducted by the University of Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Aging and the Social Security Administration.
