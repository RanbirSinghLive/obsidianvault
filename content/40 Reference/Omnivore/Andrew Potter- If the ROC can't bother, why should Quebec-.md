## Highlights

> At the very least, the two solitudes seem more estranged than ever. Last week, [Karl Tremblay died at the age of 47](https://www.lapresse.ca/societe/famille/2023-11-17/mort-de-karl-tremblay/quoi-dire-a-son-enfant.php). Who, you might ask? Tremblay was the lead singer of Les Cowboys Fringants, an enormously popular band from Quebec, and his death sent the entire province into a state of deep mourning. Premier François Legault offered his family a state funeral for Tremblay. For Quebecers, it was like when Gord Downie died. And just as Quebecers sort of just shrugged when Downie succumbed to brain cancer six years ago, the rest of Canada barely took note of Tremblay’s death.
