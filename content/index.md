[[My goal is to become a prolific writer.]] This website is part of [[My life protocol.|my life protocol]] to reach that goal. This garden lacks a hard structure because [[Play-based workflows beat task-based for creative work.]]

I'm writing a [[The Flamingos Fly|novel]] in public that's hosted entirely on this website. You can get more structured updates and tips on writing your own novel in Obsidian by reading my [[Cards/Newsletter]] or watching my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmaLdMgE7Lq1is6DYOYaow) videos.

I've also built the [[Cards/Minimal Writing System]] to help you get started writing in Obsidian!

## What I'm working on right now:
- [[Flamingo Outline|The complete outline of my novel]] 🆕
- [[On the eve of high school, Happy moves out of his childhood home due to a family fight.|The first chapter.]] 🆕
